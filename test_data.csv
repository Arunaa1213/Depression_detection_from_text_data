test_id_1,"This is me. Don鈥檛 get me wrong, it鈥檚 better than don鈥檛-leave-my-bed-for-a-week depression. I am grateful I can be an independent person. But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that鈥檚 it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time."
test_id_2,"I hate that people don鈥檛 understand that i don鈥檛 want to kill myself, I just don鈥檛 want to be alive anymore"
test_id_3,"But here I am, 24 years old man and doing exactly that."
test_id_4,I鈥檓 trapped inside. Does anyone else get that feeling? My memories from the past few years are shoddy at best. I think I鈥檓 losing it.
test_id_5,"I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.

From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape."
test_id_6,"Thank you, that really helps. Now I feel ten times worse."
test_id_7,"I don鈥檛 know if that makes sense. What I mean is that I stay up as late as possible wasting time because I know that if I go to sleep, I鈥檒l wake up and have to go to school. I usually go to bed at around 3:30am and get up at 6am and it鈥檚 destroying me, I鈥檝e been doing this for months and I鈥檓 physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it. And they always seem to get their way. 

Edit: I鈥檓 really glad that this spoke to so many people, it feels good knowing I鈥檓 not alone. Sending lots of love to you all. This isn鈥檛 easy but I believe in you 鉂わ笍"
test_id_8,"Does anyone else feel this way? This has been crossing my mind a lot lately

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments I've been recieving. It's been a nice change and I really appreciate it. You guys are the best. :)"
test_id_9,The first 6 words of the title is accurate too.
test_id_10,Fuck 馃槂
test_id_11,Just curious if anyone else affected by this problem also noticed quite a big cognitive decline. Or if anyone has noticed a cognitive decline and managed to build themselves back up to that previous cognitive level.
test_id_12,"She was only 67. She told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, I don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt.

I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

Edit: thanks everyone for your kind words, I feel less alone about this now. In lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dog's vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover. Maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further"
test_id_13,Basically what the title says and my current situation.
test_id_14,"i feel this way around everyone, friends, family, coworkers, anywhere i go. i just always feel like i鈥檓 in the background. but at the same time i like going unnoticed so i don鈥檛 have to talk to anyone and be in the spotlight.."
test_id_15,"I can鈥檛 even remember the last time i woke up excited for anything.

edit: Wanted to thank everyone for their kind words and sharing your own stories. Definitely glad to have this community it helps to know we aren鈥檛 alone even though it may feel that way."
test_id_16,"Happens to me a lot. Cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes I just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened."
test_id_17,"Like ???


I posted on AskReddit asking non-depressed people how they felt and I'm shocked. Not sure what I expected though.


You exist in this hellhole and you're just like... Chill with it? Like I'm so happy for these people but it's mindblowing! Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.


Like logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me. But I'm glad at least someone is happy in life. Idk man."
test_id_18,I can鈥檛 imagine how many days I have wasted to being sad and crying and not being able to accomplish the things I need to do. I have responsibilities I have deadlines and none of them seem to matter when I am in these dark episodes. How can you force yourself to do what needs to be done when you feel so hopeless and numb?
test_id_19,"It feels like the harder I try to better myself, the harder it pushes back."
test_id_20,"It's just so fucking tiresome. You see it everywhere on social media. People will go on and on and on about how we should all reach out to mentally ill people then when you have the courage to reach out to them the same fucking people will tell you bullshit like ""man up"", ""stop being so sensitive"", ""hey bro at least you're not a starving child in Africa"", ""bro it's just your mindset you gotta start thinking more positively"", and so on. Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed. I'm not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences. 

I just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once I want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted. Is that asking for too much?"
test_id_21,"Like, the old me wasn鈥檛 even that great either but damn"
test_id_22,"I know I have issues. But I go through manic mood swings, and while on the depressive end I feel like absolute shit, when I'm out of that phase and feel somewhat ""normal"" again I tell myself I greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind. It doesn't help that my self loathing won't let me admit that I have depression because I keep thinking I don't deserve to be depressed. So I invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits, and the cycle continues."
test_id_23,"It's just the thought, that maybe you know how to be happy. Maybe all the stuff you read online, the stuff your family tells you, the stuff you hear from your therapist, maybe it all goes somewhere in your head. Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

And I guess, that's probably not true, but sometimes, sometimes I just don't know."
test_id_24,I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. But I鈥檓 also sick of constantly feeling like I鈥檓 about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can鈥檛 go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don鈥檛 know. Anyone else feel the same?
test_id_25,"I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. 
I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. 
A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have"
test_id_26,"How do you tell someone... I'm not ignoring you right now. I'm just disconnected from reality right now, the days are all blurred together, and I feel completely numb towards everything around me. So it's really hard for me to maintain a conversation."
test_id_27,"It's always some great 1 off line that they think is the secret to fixing everything.


""Just love yourself!"" - Sure let me just go do that real quick.


""You have so much more time, things will get better!"" - Lot more time for things to get worse too :)


""You'd be disappointing your family, etc"" - Ah yes, by trapping me in the hypothetical mental state of permanently worrying about others over myself, I now get to live a happy and successful life, thank you.



Really appreciate it, thank you."
test_id_28,"Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

Edit: In case anyone is curious, I don't do drugs or drink alcohol, nor am I old. I'm just a depressed 22 year old dude."
test_id_29,"Apologies in advance for the ramble that follows and for any mistakes as this isn't my native language.

No matter how busy I make myself, it all seems pointless in the end. What the fuck am I working towards ? Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down.

Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day. Honestly feel like instead of growing as a person, I deteriorated in the last few years.

I have no motivation left except that I love my parents and them having to witness my death will destroy them. If only there was a way to erase myself from everyone's memories."
test_id_30,"You're alive, but you aren't living. You feel like doing something, anything, but nothing is appealing. Everything feels like a chore, and it's exhausting. ""Do things that you enjoy doing"" doesn't work, since everything feels like watching paint dry. Realising that you're slowly beginning to lose interest in the few things you enjoy doing and realising that there's nothing you can do about it is mentally torturing. It's like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands; it's hopeless. The only thing you look forwards to is death."
test_id_31,"*Maybe a little bit of warmth? Maybe a hug people !?*

Edit: Wow I didn't expect that many upvotes and comments. Thx yall for the virtual hugs and comfort <3 I feel better after seeing so many people on the same boat as me. THE BOAT IS GONNA SINK XD"
test_id_32,You ever feel bad for not checking up on somebody then you realise the phone goes both ways and they aren't checking up on me are they?
test_id_33,They just give you a taste of what you鈥檒l never have and when your self-esteem is at an all time low it just makes you want to kill yourself even more
test_id_34,"A house (or apartment) is surely different from a home, and it seems I haven鈥檛 had a home for many, many years now despite always having a place to stay. I understand it is a gift to have shelter, and I realize it may be insensitive to someone who is struggling with homelessness; this is just my experience."
test_id_35,My life is objectively very easy but my depression makes it all feel like a struggle
test_id_36,I'm so tired and I hate everything.
test_id_37,"I'm so tired of making excuses. I am sick, just in my head."
test_id_38,"Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?


Edit: Thank you for all the comments. I didn鈥檛 expect to get any response. It鈥檚 hard to describe, but I feel very moved that there are people out there that I reached in a small way for a short moment of time."
test_id_39,"I have never been in this low mental state before

Edit: i read every comment you all are so wholesome馃!! ! you are the best people on earth ! this subreddit is full of amazing people who understand each other! 

2 Edit: thank you for gifts !!"
test_id_40,"I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! 

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. 

Also to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)"
test_id_41,"Being suicidal is like being on a really terrible night out. I'm having a terrible time but my friends and family are all enjoying it so I stick around. They're the ones that invited me and said I'd have a good time. But as time goes on, the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so I try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but I still really just want to leave. But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that. What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here. It feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence."
test_id_42,It feels like I'm on a rollercoaster with 80% super lows and 20% kinda highs..
test_id_43,I'm never going to get better why the fuck should I even try.
test_id_44,"I MADE IT. FUCK EVERYONE WHO PUT ME DOWN. FUCK THE BULLIES, FUCK THE CLIQUES, I DID IT. But more importantly, THANK YOU to everyone who kept me going. It brings me to tears thinking about how thankful I am to be here today because of my family, friends, and the wonderful people on this subreddit who helped me when I was down. I feel so immensely proud and happy right now because of my achievements. To all the people struggling through high school and college, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!


Edit: wow thanks for all the awards, love, and support!"
test_id_45,"I wrote a suicide note today. 

I listened to funeral music.

I lined up all my pills.

I cried. And cried more.

I thought of my mom.

I thought of my dad.

I thought of Paulie.

I thought of Ang.

I thought of Kris.

I thought of everyone.

I thought of soldiers in war.

I thought of terminal illness.

I thought of my possible future..

I remembered what I'd be losing.

I felt a rage grow in me.

I put away my pills.

I listened to angry music.

I didn't kill myself today."
test_id_46,I hate this.
test_id_47,"The point I realised that I think I collapsed in some way. That I only live from one day to another. That maybe my suicidal tendencies are just wanting to stop that cycle which slowly rots my mind.

I feel like Im just a pile of dust on the edge of the table, waiting for someone to clean the table and stop my existance for good.

Idk if any of it makes any sense. If anything in life actually makes sense."
test_id_48,It's the closest thing to dying. This life sucks.
test_id_49,I miss when I was happy and life wasn't pointless.
test_id_50,"Like, I鈥檓 still alive, but I can鈥檛 experience my life anymore. I鈥檓 basically a walking dead zombie."
test_id_51,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better."
test_id_52,"You know the feeling - you're hungry and open the friedge but everything in there looks disgusting. So you either give up and don't eat or force down something that is completely unsatisfying. That is every part of my life right now.

I don't know how else to explain it. I have energy now (with my meds) and an urge to be doing something, but nothing seems appealing. 

When I do things, I don't feel good about it or pleasure. But if I sit around doing nothing, I feel the urge to be doing something.

I don't know what to do or how to explain it.

EDIT: Holy crap. Thank you everyone for the likes and awards and comments. It makes me feel connected and a little less alone. I will try to reply to all the comments."
test_id_53,"Saying things like 鈥渟he鈥檚 so emotional hahaha鈥� and telling her friend everything I just said that was making me upset.

Everything about me is just a joke to her, just a topic of discussion for her to gawk over.

I don鈥檛 even know why I鈥檓 crying, what else should I expect from someone who hasn鈥檛 ever given me any kind of legitimate emotion support."
test_id_54,"I am emotionally and physically drained. Tired of this thing called life. I hate people馃様

Edit: I just want to say thank you for your kind words. This has really shon me that I am not alone"
test_id_55,I鈥檓 too cowardly and afraid of pain to commit suicide but I just don鈥檛 want to exist.
test_id_56,"Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times. Ive been living in a hotel for 2 weeks planning to kill myself here, away from anyone i know. The thing that stops me is the thought of hurting my friends. I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it. Thank you for reading and i sincerely hope that everyone in this subreddit overcomes their depression, no matter how impossible or pointless it may seem. Good luck to everyone"
test_id_57,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

EDIT: This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards. May you all find a way to get rid of this. Lots of love."
test_id_58,"I'm discouraged today! :D 

Edit: This is a bit overwhelming. But reading all your comments was lovely. I hope every single one of you struggling will find the light one day. I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. You lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and I'll lean on the second person, etc. Have a wonderful day 鉂わ笍"
test_id_59,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I鈥檓 on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn鈥檛 expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I鈥檇 like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I鈥檇 like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn鈥檛 know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn鈥檛 angry at her because I understand that she鈥檚 struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I鈥檝e only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I鈥檓 going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn鈥檛 get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven鈥檛 dwelled on it too much. She鈥檒l reach out when she鈥檚 ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I鈥檝e been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven鈥檛 heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what鈥檚 left of the family that supports me (not many people). I鈥檓 better off being out of that toxic environment but it鈥檚 still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I鈥檓 also struggling with my marriage. I鈥檓 a military spouse and it鈥檚 hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won鈥檛 go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it鈥檚 been traumatic and hard. I haven鈥檛 gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I鈥檓 in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn鈥檛 too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn鈥檛 hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would鈥檝e been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would鈥檝e been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has gone on this year too. 

It鈥檚 okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I鈥檓 not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn鈥檛 meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so."
test_id_60,"My parents don鈥檛 seem to grasp this concept, just needed to vent"
test_id_61,"But depression is much more than that. 

It鈥檚 the excuses you have to make when you can鈥檛 make that meeting. 

It鈥檚 the friends and family you鈥檝e lost because you can鈥檛 explain why. 

It鈥檚 the opportunities that land in everyone else鈥檚 lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It鈥檚 the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It鈥檚 the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It鈥檚 your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It鈥檚 the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It鈥檚 the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It鈥檚 the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It鈥檚 not just being 鈥渟ad鈥�. And we can only wish it was. 

*Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. I wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*"
test_id_62,Title says it all. Trying to get your life together just feels like working at a job I hate.
test_id_63,"it鈥檚 the calmness around me, silence, no responsibilities, no work, just me and quiet room full of nothing. 

I just want this moment to last for as long as possible so I refuse going to sleep. 

thinking about waking up and going through another day just makes me sick."
test_id_64,"Going to sleep is my favorite thing bc I can shut off everything else.

Edited to add: I am so sorry you鈥檙e all relating to this. We can all get through these moments together. The good news is that we never have to live a day twice. Once today is over, that鈥檚 it. If we survive today we can survive tomorrow 馃挄"
test_id_65,"Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all"
test_id_66,"I always say that. 'I'd never kill myself because i wouldn't want to make my family sad.' But what if I'm 50 and still feeling this way? Suffering through decades feeling like shit, just so i won't make anyone sad seems so f.ckin exhausting. I'm sorry if I'm seeming selfish."
test_id_67,"ive never been diagnosed with anything, let alone talked to a professional but I have been chronically sad/down/depressed/who fuckin knows for years. ive been going to the gym a lot to try to stop feeling so shitty about (or let鈥檚 be real, for) myself. I never talk to anyone- just listen to my music and try to do whatever, but today this random girl asked me if I was doing okay because I looked more down than usual. i told her 鈥榠m good - thanks though鈥�! i knew I felt myself getting worse and I guess it鈥檚 showing too. 

i guess it鈥檚 nice that someone asked though, even if i lied."
test_id_68,"My only social interaction is at work but it's getting harder to pretend I'm a normal functioning human being. Haha sports, family, friends, hobbies, ambition, future, yeah I totally love them haha I am a normal human being that has things that normal beings enjoy too haha I am normal too haha"
test_id_69,"I don鈥檛 think i could ever kill myself but that doesn鈥檛 mean I don鈥檛 want to die. It鈥檇 just be so much easier than disappointing everyone I love if something just happened to me and I died. I know it isn鈥檛 right to think like this but I can鈥檛 stop.


Edit: this blew up, it鈥檚 kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. I鈥檓 home now and would love to reply to all of them but I have to do homework. Things will get better for all of us if there鈥檚 this much support in the world."
test_id_70,"I found that a lot of times in the past I would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that I was already 鈥渢rying鈥� to do and then I panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session. It鈥檚 hard to open up about it when I鈥檓 having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion, difficulty thinking and focusing, MEMORY LOSS and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating... 



*For not from depression, sorry"
test_id_71,"Just a loop of unhappiness, really hope I can fix it soon. I wanna know what the fuck happened to my motivation and care for life."
test_id_72,"I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything. Before I could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. He pressed his face to mine and I just snapped back. I鈥檓 trying so hard to get better. I鈥檓 glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn鈥檛 expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management.

To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be 鈥渃liche and boring鈥� but it鈥檚 still my fucking life. It鈥檚 my experience, I can鈥檛 change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn鈥檛 be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I鈥檓 a failure. You don鈥檛 have to tell me that. I know but I鈥檝e never been more happy to fail at something in my life."
test_id_73,Whenever I feel sad I don鈥檛 try to cheer up I try to make myself sadder because I like it more. I feel addicted to isolating myself from others and there鈥檚 a small part of me that enjoys feeling depressed and isolated. Depression feels strangely comforting at times. Does anyone else have this issue?
test_id_74,"its like when you are playing videogame and you get stuck on some part of mission,while others are having fun,you are having the worst time in ur entire life"
test_id_75,Today I was feeling extremely low. I don't know but my I feel like my ability to process information and write has been decreased. I'm just so angry and irritable. I hate this feeling
test_id_76,"For most people nostalgia is generally accepted as being a nice feeling, a pleasant memory. But for me it just reminds of a more innocent, happier time when I was child. I thought my future was good and all I cared about was playing with friends and climbing trees. How things have changed

Edit: I genuinely didn't expect so many kind comments even on a sub like this. I feel better and I have you all to thank for that."
test_id_77,what do you guys say when someone gets mad at you for being sad? or when your being moody because your sad?
test_id_78,
test_id_79,"I hate how people who I thought knew better tell me that I'm lazy, I'm not. I wanna get up and be excited to do stuff but I'm just not. I'm tired all the time and everything doesn't seem to excite me anymore."
test_id_80,"Idk if that makes sense. But I don't want to kill myself, I really don't. I want to be killed. I want to be shot or to not wake up. I don't want to make the choice to kill myself because my friends and family will feel responsible but I want to die."
test_id_81,Do you guys see what I鈥檓 saying here. I鈥檓 always constantly completely bullshitting myself 24/7. I always pretend that there are a few certain things that would make me feel a little better then I get them and I want the opposite. Complete self destruction and all
test_id_82,"*CW* 

anywhere, really, work/jobs included. I can't keep track of my lies. My ""headaches"" and ""migraines"" and ""feeling sick"" are all lies. I can't keep track of them. I wish instead of saying ""I stayed home because of my headache"" I could say the truth ""I have no motivation or energy. I want to kill myself. I hate myself so much and I want to die. I can't even drink water or eat healthy. I can't even do my work. I want to kill myself""."
test_id_83,"This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence."
test_id_84,I lowkey wish I can be pushed over the edge so I'll have the courage to end it all (as horrible as that sounds)
test_id_85,I wonder how much longer I can continue like this
test_id_86,"As the title says. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse at everything. I feel like I'm getting weaker, much much dumber (I used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. Now I've forgotten most things unless I read up on it daily, I've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and I've become completely socially unaware). Things that used to be easy are now difficult, I constantly make typos and I can't even concentrate on things I like, much less things I dislike.

Anyone else feel like that?"
test_id_87,"I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn鈥檛 even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn鈥檛 control. Now I鈥檓 21 and just graduated college and I鈥檓 lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I鈥檓 afraid to tell anyone because I don鈥檛 want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I鈥檓 just so broken right now. Can anyone relate to this crippling regret of missing out on what were supposed to be the best years of your life?"
test_id_88,"brushing hair, taking a bath, brushing teeth and putting on something nice is too damn hard with depression."
test_id_89,"I can鈥檛 stop crying because I think I may have receding gums. I just lay in bed all day and cry, and the only reason I haven鈥檛 killed myself yet is because of my cat- who can鈥檛 even live with me anymore because of my landlord. So I send my dad money to feed him.
Everything is shit. I never brushed my teeth consistently for years and now it鈥檚 fucking me. I鈥檓 so ashamed my face is disgusting. My face I don鈥檛 have the energy to wash and my teeth are getting yellow because I never have the energy to brush

EDIT: thank you so much for all the beautiful replies <3 I slept for a while and I made sure to read everyone鈥檚 comments before brushing my teeth and washing my face this morning- baby steps<3 I鈥檓 so glad I found this r/."
test_id_90,"I dunno, I鈥檒l always think it鈥檚 getting better and then nope, hits like a damn truck, knocks me to the ground, and runs over me. 

It always gets better for a bit, or I start to look forward to things, but clearly there鈥檚 no point to hoping if it all crashes and crumbles. If you don鈥檛 look forward to anything, you can鈥檛 be let down."
test_id_91,"After bordering on suicidal yesterday, I was surprised to find I had the motivation to get out of bed when I woke up this morning. The first thing I did was make my bed, and that鈥檚 a victory in my book. 

I love you all.

Edit: Thank you for the Silver, and for the heartwarming comments. It means a lot!

Edit 2: This has me all kinds of emotional. I鈥檝e never had so much faith in the kindness of strangers."
test_id_92,"WELL I SURE SHOWED THEM, DIDN'T I?

I'm a massive fuckup. I forget things the minute after I am told them. There's just a massive pile of fuzzy static in my head. My grammar has devolved into caveman-speak.

I dunno if I blame my mental health or if I'm just stupid."
test_id_93,"I have full conversations with friends I don't have, about stories I haven't lived. I imagine how they'd respond and laugh at my jokes.

I don't have any real friends, I spend my life alone because I have no real confidence in myself. I feel my youth wasting away and I hate who I am. I am unemployed so I couldn't have moved out from home.

I imagine myself as a successful athlete (I know it's stupid) and I imagine how I'd interact with people and the questions they'd ask.

It's disappointing to come back to my real life and realize what I am. I've done nothing with my life for the past 8 years. And nothing is moving forward. I compare myself to other men my age, and I am a failure in every aspect. I am no better today than I was 5 years ago.

I wish I could escape into my fantasies"
test_id_94,"I didn鈥檛 even realise it myself until I took 2 tabs of acid and could look in at my life from an outside perspective, I鈥檓 awful to be around. I suck the energy out of every situation, I鈥檓 no fun, I鈥檓 never in the mood for laughing because I just constantly feel like crying. I鈥檓 like a black hole that sucks all the fun away and everyone on the outside just sees someone who鈥檚 constantly in a bad mood, there goes any chance of potential new friends approaching me. I wondered why people leave you during depression but I got it after that, I wouldn鈥檛 want to be around me either."
test_id_95,"You know how many people reject me and judge me for my mental illness/trauma? Guys will fucking play me, act all into me at first, and then flip the script and be like 鈥渙h srry this ain鈥檛 gonna work out, u don鈥檛 rlly love me ur just miserable haha bye鈥� (they don鈥檛 say that literally but im trying to summarize lol) LIKE WTF?! You knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one! Why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways! Do you know how devastating and invalidating that is? That鈥檚 like saying someone with a disability can鈥檛 love someone because they鈥檙e not 鈥渘ormal鈥�. Tbh I think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets. Since I鈥檓 mental and I鈥檝e been abused my entire life they think they can just walk all over me, and are surprised when I stand up for myself and don鈥檛 allow them to do that. Well, screw you and fuck off馃枙馃徑"
test_id_96,"Too much of a coward to kill myself, but at the same time have no reason to live. I just need to know that I鈥檓 not alone who feels like this in this hour."
test_id_97,"Depression isn鈥檛 just being depressed all the time. Anger and feeling numb is also a big part of it. Before I was diagnosed, I was a lot to handle. I would get angry for no reason and destroyed my things as an ineffective coping mechanism. I even went as far as assaulting my mom once but luckily, I have a mother who was nice enough to not press charges and encouraged me to go into therapy. I now know better ways to handle my anger. Of course most angry people arent depressed (some people are just miserable) but depressed people are often angry. Also I鈥檓 not excusing my past actions I just did what I did and I can鈥檛 take it back"
test_id_98,"I just go through the routine every day, and kinda let everything just pass by. I don't really have much of an emotional response to anything, and my personality feels like a mush of stuff. Like, whenever things go wrong, people say they want to die, and while, yeah, I don't like what happened, I just feel kinda... neutral."
test_id_99,"It鈥檚 so stressful. There鈥檚 so many things I want to do but I just can鈥檛 at the moment and it sucks. Theoretically, I could be physically paralyzed for months and it would be just the same as if I wasn鈥檛 paralyzed and living my regular depressed life. Watching your life go by without any motives and meaning as you have no one there beside you because you鈥檝e kicked everyone out of your life is one of the worst feelings for me."
test_id_100,I鈥檝e felt empty for days and just now cried a little. Even though I鈥檓 miserable I was almost happy. It鈥檚 worse to feel like you鈥檙e dead than being sad.
test_id_101,"I hate working, I do believe I may be lazy but, I also hate the idea of wasting my life on something I'm not passionate in. I have no passions for existing, I'm just here because I don't want to hurt my family. They'd be devastated if I committed suicide. I try to work and it's getting to the point where I'll last a day or two then I just stop going. They say ""you not supposed to like your job or career but, money money money"". Nobody asked to be a wage slave to maintain a living! I don't know what to do I'm 25 with no goals, two semesters of college that I got a 1.5 gpa in. I kept having panic attacks especially during exams. I wasn't built for this life!"
test_id_102,"Everytime I get a compliment, my brain says it's fake. I just hate myself."
test_id_103,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn鈥檛 understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I鈥檓 currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can鈥檛 get out of bed... I can鈥檛 do the dishes. I can鈥檛 pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can鈥檛. 

I just.. I can鈥檛 hear the 鈥渂ut.. why are you depressed?鈥� question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I鈥檝e been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone鈥檚 life. 


Anyway, that鈥檚 all. I鈥檓 sure no one will even read this. K bye

Edit: I鈥檓 really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing. 馃グ"
test_id_104,"My depression has been doing so good, I鈥檓 so proud. But my mom passed away last night of pulmonary veno occlusive disease. Really needing positivity in these trying times. Thank you so much <3"

fuck everything"
test_id_106,"Dreams are always fantastical situations for me. They're strange and whatever, but there's always a new one and I'm excited to get out of reality. Plus I don't have to consciously do anything, but it still feels like I did everything."
test_id_107,"I鈥檓 double majoring in college and working two volunteer jobs right now but I don鈥檛 have the motivation to eat, shower or do laundry. I basically live off of take out because I can鈥檛 bring myself to cook and I don鈥檛 know how long it鈥檚 been since I鈥檝e washed my jeans. 


To everyone struggling with depression-I hear you, I see you and you are valid."
test_id_108,i wish i could still be motivated throughout the day.
test_id_109,"I don't know if I'm depressed or if I've just lost my personality and identity. I don't know if this is me now or what? 
I'm nothing like the old me and it kills me to admit it. 7 years back dad said it was just a stage I'm going through, yet here I am. All my friends are still themselves I'm completely fucking different"
test_id_110,It's a pain to live and I don't want my loved ones to feel a little bit of sadness for my suicide. I know they don't care but... I just want a hug. Even a large bathe tub with warm water will do. The only problems are the bills. Fuck this
test_id_111,"I鈥檝e felt better these past few months. A lot better, great even. But this Christmas it鈥檚 like... I can鈥檛 bring myself to care for the Holidays - and it鈥檚 my favourite Holiday. I can鈥檛 explain it. 

My family lives two hours away and I almost didn鈥檛 go, just because I wanted to be alone in my apartment, doing absolutely nothing. But I鈥檓 a single child, my parents are single children, all my grandparents are dead - it鈥檚 just us three. They鈥檙e getting old, too. I couldn鈥檛 just *not* go. They would have been so sad and I don鈥檛 want that.

But I鈥檓 just empty and miserable and it鈥檚 Christmas so I have to put up a front, a nice dress and be nice.

Gosh this is hard.

Merry Christmas.

Edit: wow, you guys know how to make someone feel special and a little less alone. Thank you, kind strangers! 鉂わ笍"
test_id_112,"one day where i don't have to apologize for existing, one day where i can just exist instead of vowing to do better, to improve, to work harder, to be worthy

my whole life is a stupid apology."
test_id_113,"This has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. I'm 50 now, so obviously I haven't succumbed to depression yet. But the peaks and valleys are insane; I guess *I'm* insane. Yesterday it fully made sense to me - if I had had immediate means to end my life I could see taking that action. This is why I can never have a gun, or live in a tall building. 
So far that small voice in me that says ""It will get better, just wait"" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says ""You've always been alone. You'll always be alone. Life isn't worth the pain."" My reality is having both of those voices in my brain, and feeling that both are absolutely real when they're there."
test_id_114,"My depression has depression bro. A lot of the time I doubt that I have a mental illness, and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things. I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it鈥檚 normal to feel empty. It鈥檚 strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I鈥檓 alone in this? It鈥檚 weird. I tell myself things like, 鈥渢his isn鈥檛 because of the depression, it鈥檚 because you鈥檙e worthless and incapable of doing anything.鈥� I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing. But deep down I would give anything in the world to feel happiness. 
I hope this isn鈥檛 just me. Like deadass, I don鈥檛 know if I鈥檓 the only person who feels like this. And if I am that鈥檚 just gonna scare me."
test_id_115,"I don鈥檛 wanna end it all, but I鈥檓 just tired of living. Like each day kind of feels pointless. I feel exhausted just thinking about doing the same thing every day. I鈥檓 not happy and feel no purpose. It鈥檚 like I want it to be the next day, and the next day comes, and I鈥檓 wishing it was the next. I don鈥檛 know how to explain it. I鈥檓 just existing and not living. 

Am I going through a phase? Anyone else feel the same way? What helps?"
test_id_116,"So this happened about 5 months ago but I found out about it this morning right after she broke up with me. We had been dating just about a year and I genuinely loved her with all my heart. I trusted her so much and she knew I have severe depression. I cant understand how another human can be that shitty. Anyone willing to talk?


EDIT: just found out she cheated on me with another guy too. She's completely blaming it on me despite me treating her nothing but great while we dated. Back to feeling terrible again, just after the responses to this post made me actually feel pretty good :')"
test_id_117,"Finally opened up a little to my teacher about how I was feeling and she told me I was childish and ""giving off helpless vibes""

It's alright, I guess I agree with her, I just wish she hadn't told the whole class that ""your feelings are valid and you have to talk about them"" etc etc, because she clearly doesn't care and I feel stupid now. 

Never again."
test_id_118,"I was doing well until last week when I started sleeping 12 hours again, not eating then over-eating, feeling exhausted at the idea of a shower, crying, being irritable, all of the textbook signals of depression. I鈥檓 pushing my partner away and isolating again. 

I鈥檝e been suddenly reminded depression never goes away, it just lays dormant until it decides to come back, at least in my case. I get my hopes up that I鈥檝e 鈥渇igured it out,鈥� and am brutally reminded that I haven鈥檛 and never will. 

I鈥檓 just tired & very, very sad. I鈥檓 sorry for complaining.

Edit: WOW, I did not expect this many people to resonate so strongly with this. Thank you to all who have contributed to the discussion. :)"
test_id_119,"I literally don鈥檛 want to do anything at all. It doesn鈥檛 bring me any happiness or joy or whatever. At best, just distracts me from feeling shitty. Absolutely nothing helps. Video games, writing, reading, doing photography, drawing... none of that makes me happy.

It鈥檚 the absolute fucking WORST. I don鈥檛 even feel like sleeping, but I don鈥檛 wanna be awake either. I go to bed before 7pm because I have nothing else I wanna do. All I do is lie in bed and listen to miserable songs and cry, then I go to sleep, wake up and repeat.

I hate living. I hate this existence. I wish I could just die in my sleep.

EDIT: This got a lot more attention than I thought so I just wanna day that I鈥檓 reading all your comments and I love you all"
test_id_120,"I try and do anything and everything all day. I can't be alone with my thoughts so my objective is to do as much as I can to keep busy. Every evening I'm exhausted, emotionally drained and still depressed. I feel like I'm beating back a relentless force. I feel like I've been robbed of being proud of the little things I do like washing my face or baking because I do that anyway so it's not like I can be proud of the effort I've put in. My biggest fear is waking up and not having anything to do, just be in my head. Fortunately I'm able eat, brush my teeth and do things every day and to the outsider I look like I'm doing really well but I'm struggling a lot. Before this there was a year of staying in bed and not doing anything but now that I'm doing things everyday I feel even more hopeless. It's proof that even if I'm proactive in my life I feel as shit as I would if I did fuck all."
test_id_121,"I'm so fucking done with this shit. I've had multiple exams this week all during my colleges green beer day fesitivies, which I've had to skip due to studying. Then I get asked why I'm not at our parties, and my friends asking why I haven't been going to the gym with them. Then my parents asking why I'm spending money at Chipotle and Wendy's and shit like I'm supposed to be eating green ass shit from whole foods all day. Then I'm supposed to also be spending time playing sports and video games and reading bc apparently that's the shit I like to do. Fuck this. How is anyone supposed to do this? What the fuck is the point. Sorry for ranting. Fuck this week. Been shit. Anyone want to talk? I need a study break I wanna help some people, maybe do some good in this fucked world. Love all of you"
test_id_122,"I was doing fine this past month, I鈥檝e been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven鈥檛 been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we鈥檙e alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn鈥檛 let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she鈥檚 not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We鈥檝e only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn鈥檛 completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I鈥檓 still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I鈥檓 over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed 鈥渁lmost relationship鈥� again is messing with my head and I鈥檓 starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I鈥檝e spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It鈥檚 hard when I put all my effort into people that don鈥檛 do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I鈥檓 starting to think I鈥檓 the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she鈥檚 not worth it, I don鈥檛 think it鈥檚 her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don鈥檛 know what to do anymore.

tdlr; things were fine until they weren鈥檛 and I just don鈥檛 know what to do anymore"
test_id_123,"This world and all the people living in it is such a heaping pile of horseshit. Nobody has a fuck to give about mental illness. It's blatantly obvious. Fuck this.

Edit: This post isn't about me, it's about other people."
test_id_124,"I pulled up to work, and saw a semi truck. And outta nowhere I get the urge to dive under it. 

As soon as I thought it, it hit me how unwell I feel and am. We really spend alot of our time just thinking of dying."
test_id_125,"But I do. Every time. Because saying ""I threw up everywhere last night"" gets you a ""Oh sweetie, take the day off to rest, it's okay!"", but saying ""My depression is acting up really badly and I just can't do it today"" gets you a ""Don't be lazy! Everyone gets sad, suck it up and come into work!"".

I shouldn't have to be fucking ashamed of my depression. It's as medical as the flu, yet people seem to think mental illnesses aren't a valid reason, and that you're not really sick.

Fuck that shit. We need to break the stigma towards mental illnesses in general."
test_id_126,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

Edit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did. You guys have given some real good advice and I'm thankful for it, thank you."
test_id_127,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

Edit: I don't know what to say right now... Last time I looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and I was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now I see this... Thank you so much, this means the world to me."
test_id_128,"Life is too much. Really. I could never killed myself bc I'm too much of a coward to indulge me any kind of harm, but those days I just don't know what to do.

I'm always waking with the urge to die, I cry myself to sleep, when I wake up I cry as well it just doesn't seem to stop.
I'm 20 and I feel that I'm stuck in a 16yo mentality. I'm in some studies that are really demanding and I'm just wasting time bc I'm too much of a failure to succeed anything.
My few friends are moving forward, are happy whereas I'm stuck and never been in a relationship.
I don't have any motivation, or goal my life seems dull and just not worth it.

EDIT: Finally got back here and wow, did this take off. I went through every last one of your comments. I'm in a brain fog even as I write this so I don't have the right words but thank you for all your stories, support, advice, information and so much more.

As much in pain as I am right now I am so grateful. Because until now I was missing a huge understanding of my condition. A doctor once told me I was ""living in a dark room."" Well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps, and possible permanent loss of function, that go along with this disease.

So I hope you have had ""a-ha"" moments about your condition too. So that we can all be on the way to recovery, like some have fortunately accomplished."
test_id_130,Does anyone else agree their favourite time is when everyone is sleeping and your awake. It鈥檚 like your just existing and they鈥檙e paused. I wish it could be like that forever where u don鈥檛 have to explain anything. You can just exist.
test_id_131,I always feel angry or annoyed or nothing is going right and I've felt like this around the same time as my depression reared its ugly head. So many things piss me off. I sometimes even go into borderline misanthropy because of my depression induced anger. It's led me to have fights with people who are my family and friends and I don't know why I push them away
test_id_132,"I read this a lot here, ""I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I didn't exist"". I identify with that... so much. I just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as I'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for?

Edit: wow, I did not expect to get so many responses when I wrote this yesterday. Although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. For those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also. I hope that you all find peace one way or another, just as I hope that I can too. But let's face it, chances are that's won't be tonight, so.... here we go again."

test_id_138,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown: with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you."

test_id_145,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster. it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context. 

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves. We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start. 

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone. It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement. Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea. Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet. 

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders. It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole. Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole. Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone. It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**. (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.) 

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively. Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**. If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma. 

* We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others. These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
test_id_146,"I never asked to be brought on this world, and yet I'm expected to be a ""normal adult"" and get a job, move out and maintain relationships (things that I've never known how to do). I feel like if I'll be by myself for a month I'll end it all honestly. I never asked for any of this. People think this excuse is playing the victim game, and they may be right, but why the fuck is suicide bad then? Am I supposed to rot on the streets instead? I'm just angry and I hate this. Thanks for reading."
test_id_147,"No, I鈥檓 not angry. No, I鈥檓 not sad about anything in particular. No, I鈥檓 not upset with you. 

I just have no energy and don鈥檛 feel like talking or doing anything. So please stop making me feel guilty for being this way, please stop being short and impatient with me, please give me time and space. 

Just please, stop assuming what mood I鈥檓 in and actually listen to me for once before you actually do put me in a bad mood."
test_id_148,"Hi y鈥檃ll,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I鈥檓 a 20yo man. I鈥榤 Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I鈥檒l call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to 芦 flirt 禄. Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren鈥檛 as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy. She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it鈥檚 so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more 芦 serious 禄 (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn鈥檛 agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it鈥檚 unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her. We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda that clich茅 of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I鈥榙 have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn鈥檛 the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn鈥檛 stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence. She was a very funny person as well. She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I鈥檇 even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it. She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that. But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence. I鈥檝e never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I鈥檝e ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter. My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me. She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally. She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people. She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I鈥榤 not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it鈥檇 have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved. But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way. No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it鈥檚 extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents鈥� for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents鈥� and me at mine, there wasn鈥檛 even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more. It鈥檚 absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I鈥榙 never forgive myself.
It鈥檚 an ongoing case so I鈥檓 not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn鈥檛 have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn鈥檛 prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I鈥榣l fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown. But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it鈥檚 because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I鈥檒l be happy again and I鈥榣l meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it鈥檚 wrong, first I鈥榣l never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it鈥檚 unbearable to survive since she鈥榮 no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn鈥檛 now that I鈥榤 desperate without her that I鈥榣l want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she鈥榣l never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I鈥檓 芦 relieved 禄 that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don鈥檛 see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very 芦 strong 禄 and now I鈥榤 extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they鈥榬e also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I鈥榣l go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I鈥檓 not afraid of the judgement, I know they鈥榣l have a long sentence but I鈥榤 very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they鈥榬e going to say, I鈥榤 anxious I cannot bear it. For the moment I鈥檓 trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn鈥檛 want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it鈥檚, when I鈥檓 there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don鈥檛 think anyone will have read this anyway."
test_id_149,Today is one of those days where I feel miserable haven't gotten out of bed. I just feel awful.
test_id_150,"I want to be able to melt into someone鈥檚 arms and know I鈥檓 fully loved and that they have my back

I want a support system

I want to be able to relax and breathe

I鈥檓 so tired"
test_id_151,"I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they鈥檝e kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned 鈥渋f I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don鈥檛 know what I would do with myself.鈥� Anyway, I don鈥檛 get into depressive moods too often anymore, it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don鈥檛 know if it鈥檚 something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don鈥檛 have the money for the trip, but that鈥檚 ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. 

Sorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head."
test_id_152,"I sleep so much. I enjoy it because it鈥檚 an escape without death. I don鈥檛 want to die but I don鈥檛 enjoy living, so I sleep. It鈥檚 a way of 鈥渓iving鈥� without actually having to live. Sigh. If I could stay in bed all day and sleep, I would."
test_id_153,I recently (like 5 minutes ago) scrolled through the notes app and read my suicide note that I typed up 3 years ago and it was very short and formal lmao if I were to write one right now it鈥檇 probably just say 鈥渋t izzz what it izzz鈥� 馃ぃ馃ぃ馃ぃ
test_id_154,"Just wanted to share what happened. We could do with some more positivity in here. I鈥檝e only had my kitten for 4 days and I love her with all my heart, she makes me feel so much better and reduces my panic attacks. She heals my heart <3"
test_id_155,"I swear to God, if I manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like ""If only she talked to us we'd have helped"" I'm coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell.

Keep your problem to yourself and your therapist because everyone else WILL use them to hurt you."
test_id_156,"So my cat apparently got alzheimers and it's breaking my heart... All the things we have been through, he has been there for me like no other person in my life has, all the play and joy, hardships, running in and out to the vet, petting him and loving him, waking up every morning with him looking at me and meowing, following me downstairs and watch me make coffee... and now, all that is gone. It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo... But not making contact with me, not cuddling, not meowing. I look into his eyes and I don't see him there anymore.. I am so sad right now I don't know how to think positively about the future without him. I feel completely shattered.."
test_id_157,"Ive just dropped and smashed a plate in the kitchen and cleaning it up, my brain took over of telling me how useless and stupid I am because i cant even hold onto a plate. Its so humiliating for myself.


Edit: Im just about to go to bed after settling down and it took a few hours for me to get back to my normal mindset. Also, the responses to this have been eye opening as i really didnt expect anyone to pay attention. Thank you all for comments and i hope we can all manage to get past the difficult times brought on by not so difficult things. 馃グ鉂�"
test_id_158,"Every single one of them left me on read. 

I am really not doing well isolated in quarantine and I get text conversations are the lowest form of communication. but it's all we got in these times. (I am in Michigan with the highest current covid cases in the US, and seeing people isn't really an option).

I even texted my friend (who I was just Bestman for in October) that I am not doing well and really need to talk to someone and he has ghosted me. Many of these friends come to me when they are alone, depressed, or need advice. (Also he is the most glued to his phone type of person I have ever met). 

I am in therapy, and I get like regular people aren't qualified to discuss these topics sometimes and feel uncomfortable about the topic, but I guess I had hoped one of my friends would listen. I am feeling extra bad that I have to literally pay someone to listen to me, makes me wonder if I am insufferable."

test_id_160,"I want someone to hug me because they want to. I want someone to hug me because they want a hug too, not just because they pity me.

I don't want a hug from my mom, my grandma or whatever. I want a hug from a person who didn't brought me here. I want a hug from who wants to be with me, because they are attracted by me.

I'm sick of pity. I want real affection.

Edit: I'm living in France for the ones wondering."
test_id_161,"I cannot possibly imagine life without depression. Being happy? What the fuck is that? What鈥檚 having an awesome family like? never had one. Can you imagine being smart, at the top of your game? I can鈥檛. 

I鈥檓 just a nobody. I die, and the the world continues as always. The entire thing is just pointless. We live, we die. The end."
test_id_162,"I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

P.S. the ice cream was terrible"
test_id_163,"does anyone else find themselves constantly just thinking about dying or disappearing and just not wanting to exist but also not committed enough to end things? 

like I find nearly nothing redeeming about my life - I know there's good in it but it's just not enough anymore - so I just daydream about dying so I don't have to pretend to be okay anymore. I'm not planning to kill myself, but I find myself wishing I could because this disinterested floating through life is just pointless"
test_id_164,"Like, your presence is not important, everything would be the same even without you."
test_id_165,"So most of you probably didn鈥檛 even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can鈥檛 lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can鈥檛 be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I鈥檝e started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn鈥檛 respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they鈥檙e okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say 鈥渇uck you depression, I鈥檓 better than you.鈥�"
test_id_166,"I woke up and immediately started looking for things to be bothered with, I'm tired of this. 


How do you do to let go of things?"
test_id_167,"I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right?

So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. 

But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit."
test_id_168,"I've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc I'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking. 

It's reached the point where instead of saying ""fuck"" when something goes wrong I'll say ""I want to kill myself"". It's become so engrained in my mind that I've come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around. 

Anyone else do this?"
test_id_169,"I dont have a reason to be depressed but. Its just sometimes i feel fine and then all of a sudden i just dont want to do anything and i feel an ache in my chest. Idk man. I guess it might be that my parents arent able to bring in no money and its just in my conscious and pops out evry now and then. Am i just faking my ""depression""? 

Let me know if im the only one that feels like this?

EDIT: I just want to say that i tried responding to all the messages but i just got overwhelmed and got busy with trying to help my dad with work. but thank you to everyone who gave me words kf encouragement and i am deeply sorry to everyone who feels the same way. oh and thank you kind person for my first gold award! :)

EDIT #2: Thank you to my second gold award. i really appreciate it alot. but you people really dont have to spend money to just give me a virtual award. but i an thankful and it does make me kinda feel wanted. thank you <3"
test_id_170,"Do you know this feeling? I feel like I'm nothing more than a vessel. I feel like I just want to scream, all this hopelessness and the suffering is too much for me. But this vessel helps to contain and suppress these feelings. I feel dead inside. Just existing cause I can't bring the courage up to kill myself. It feels like I'm trapped between a livable life and death."
test_id_171,"I feel like I鈥檓 drowning on land, I鈥檝e been thinking a lot about suicide lately. It feels like just a short time ago I was starting to feel happy and excited about life. Now I just want it to end, I was fooling myself into thinking there is something worth living for. Maybe things will change but I鈥檓 doubtful right now.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind messages. I also want to say I understand my suicidal ideations involving other people is wrong and I promise I will not put another persons life at risk should I choose to follow through with suicide (which I am hoping not to) I am still in a very dark place but your words of encouragement and support have helped me see things a bit more clearly."
test_id_172,Fuck New Years by the way
test_id_173,"I feel like I'm wasting my life being depressed.
I keep hearing 'give it time, it'll get better'

Yeah
Maybe eventually it'll get better and I'll have wasted the better part of my young adulthood trying to figure out how to produce serotonin.

We only get one life, and I've already spent a quarter of it feeling like shit.

I honestly hope reincarnation is true because if not then I've thoroughly wasted my one chance at a halfway decent life."
test_id_174,"This quote helps me to explain how I feel, when people ask questions about depression"
test_id_175,"It never ends. Everything I do sooner or later becomes another chore. No happiness, no joy. Just nothing.
I sat down between reps to my chair, and wondered about suicide for 5 minutes.
Fuck everyone who says eating healthy or exercise could fix this shit. Sometimes it just can鈥檛. And it makes you more miserable."
test_id_176,"The first advice you see on googling depression is 'do things you used to enjoy!', right? Well, I've gotten really good at making myself do things. I make myself do my job. I make myself do a side hustle. I make myself read books and post about them on my blog. This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo. 


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution. 

&#x200B;

I'm trying to make myself go for a walk every day, because that's supposed to be good for your mood, and it feels like an actual punishment."
test_id_177,"Like I'll be out trying to enjoy myself and I'll be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but I still feel sad underneath, hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling. Even hobbies I have just seem dull and I'm usually just trying to mask the pain so I don't have to feel. 

I hate this."
test_id_178,"No stress, no depression, just vibing while I consume nearby prokaryotes and shit.

Deadlines? There are no deadlines, only mitosis.

Lonely? Fuck it, I'll just make another me and we'll be best pals as we swim around in primordial soup.

Humanity was a fucking mistake, I want to return to amoeba where I belong."
test_id_179,"Sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually I will commit suicide. This realization really fucks me up. I wish this wasn鈥檛 the case. I wish so much I could be normal and happy but it鈥檚 been years and I鈥檝e begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable. I hope I鈥檓 proven wrong.

Edit: it鈥檚 been 160 days since I posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset I still come back often and read all the new comments.

test_id_180,"Depressed people who can manage to do the bare minimum (shower enough to not be noticeably unhygienic, show up to work, fake being alright while socializing) are labeled as high functioning. But I don鈥檛 feel high functioning at all. I feel like I鈥檓 actually just barely functioning. I鈥檓 just doing enough to appear alright to others, but nothing else extra. I just don鈥檛 think high functioning is the right label for most 鈥渉igh functioning鈥� people."
test_id_181,"Depression is a bitch. I don鈥檛 want attention, I just feel worthless. Being my only company feels toxic because I hate myself. It鈥檚 so conflicting because I want to be alone. I don鈥檛 have the energy anymore to put on a fake smile like I used to. I distance myself from my friends and they don鈥檛 notice. Yet I don鈥檛 want to be alone because I鈥檓 drowning in a pool of self hatred and depression. I try to reach out and force myself to meet with people but plans always fall through. I just want to be reminded every now and then that people care for me because I feel fucking worthless. It doesn鈥檛 help when that validation never comes."
test_id_182,"Like, not a full blown panic attack, but just the constant uncomfortable feeling of something not being right?"
test_id_183,This has happened to me twice this week. I think I鈥檓 dying.
test_id_184,"I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn鈥檛 help. 

There isn鈥檛 anything wrong with me. I鈥檓 young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I鈥檝e had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I鈥檝e been told I am strong because I haven鈥檛 done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven鈥檛 killed myself. I鈥檓 not strong, I鈥檓 guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn鈥檛 cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I鈥檓 not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the 鈥済ood鈥� therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn鈥檛 talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can鈥檛 help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn鈥檛 make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn鈥檛 make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn鈥檛 matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won鈥檛 affect anyone.

Edit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.

I really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood."

test_id_189,"I want to die so badly, but I cant do this to them. They greeted me with smiles and joy. My mother asking if I ate anything and if I wanted breakfast. My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them. I just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way."
test_id_190,"I'm so tired of my feelings being ignored by my friends and family. I'm tired of the emotional abuse I have been through. I'm tired of dealing with having bpd. I literally cannot do this anymore. I CAN'T. I feel so empty and nothing feels worth doing, I have no friends, and I'm hurting. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'll find a way. I genuinely believe that in killing myself I will finally find some peace.

I truly don't think anyone cares about me or that this will hurt anyone, but I'm sorry if it does. I'll be watching over you from above and same to anyone dealing with these same issues.

I'm sorry I just can't do this.

Edit: Thank you for all the awards and comments I have recieved. I've done my best to reply to reply to all of you because I appreciate all of the time people took out to comment on my post. The amount of love and support I have received is overwhelming. I hope you all know that the I reciprocate the love and care you have shown me. You guys gave me some hope and even made me cry a little. I feel better and if anyone else needs help, please reach out to me so I can pass on this good energy. This made my day so much better. I love you all."
test_id_191,"it's stupid, but i always doubt the fact i have depression, even after getting an official diagnosis, i'm still scared that i'm just an attention whore taking up everyone's time. Most of the time when i go to post something on here, i end up deleting it because i don't want someone in the comments to say something like ""your not actually depressed, your just a whiny teen"". I don't know.

test_id_192,Im always saying sorry for being an inconvenience
test_id_193,"I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything. Sure is loads of fun."
test_id_194,"Anyone else feel like that?


Edit: I just have absolutely zero motivation. Everything had gone wrong. I'm a disappointment to everyone, and all I do I hurt the people who love me simply by existing because I'm such a failure. I wake up in the morning and already feel defeated. How am I supposed to get through the day when it's already hit me like a steamroller

test_id_195,"I don't know if this is the correct term to use for what I am referring to, but I feel like I can't be living the same way most human do.

I used to be a smart and intuitive girl, but for the past couple of years it's like I have no idea what's going on around me, I can't remember anything, I feel so fucking dumb all the time, and everything feels blurry and confusing. I think I've been holding in too much and my body and brain are shutting down. That's my best guess.

I just wake up and do the bare minimum to exist (and often times don鈥檛 even achieve that as I dwell in self neglect...) and pour every minute o can into video games until I鈥檓 exhausted enough to pass out within minutes of laying down, because if I don鈥檛 then I鈥檒l lay in bed for hours making myself (even more) miserable. This is so awful and so difficult and it feels impossible to do anything about it. I am in hell."
test_id_203,"What is even the fucking point anymore? I took my bird out when the door was open and it flew off my shoulder. In a moment of panic I slammed the door... right onto his head. Everyone in my family is telling me 鈥渋t鈥檚 not your fault鈥� and 鈥渋t was a mistake鈥�, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? ME. And now my mistakes are causing the deaths of those I love. I hate myself so much I don鈥檛 even see the point of going on anymore.

Edit: Oh my god, thank you everyone! It鈥檚 been a really hard day and the support I鈥檝e had from my family and you guys has helped a lot. It鈥檚 still an on going process, but I鈥檓 trying not to blame myself for it. Hearing your stories actually helped a lot, it let me know I wasn鈥檛 alone in this and that it is possible to move on. Thanks guys :)"
test_id_204,"I don鈥檛 know if there鈥檚 something physically wrong with me or if it鈥檚 just stress related, but for about 2 years now, I feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening. 

I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. 

I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I鈥檓 recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I鈥檓 actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery.

I don鈥檛 know where to go. I鈥檝e really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now.

EDIT: ironically enough, I forgot to mention that my memory is complete shit now. My long term memory isn鈥檛 bad but holy shit, I鈥檒l forget what you said in a conversation 10 seconds after it鈥檚 said."
test_id_205,"I don't know am I the only one with this, but every time things start going better, it never feels right. I feel like I don't deserve being okay. The sadness has become like an addiction. It feels weirdly good? 

I don't really know, but whenever I'm the lowest it feels the most comforting. I think I've already gave up on trying to heal. Trying get help. I don't want it anymore. I'm miserable and slowly becoming crazy but I don't think I'm even trying to fix it anymore. I've accepted it. 

I'm just waiting for the opportunity to finally bring myself to the end."
test_id_206,I'm so fucking tired of feeling like i can't ever catch up. To anyone or anything. I can't keep up with life I'm so fucking tired of it. Why do I always feel like being alive is an uphill battle. I feel like i was damned upon conception. I was fucked from the start. With my fucked up head and my fucked up emotions I was FUCKED FROM THE START. I never stood a chance here. Why the living fuck do I always feel like I'm a thousand steps behind everyone else. Sometimes I want to end my life so badly but I am too afraid to hurt my family. I keep holding out for some god damn hope but every single fucking time it is proven that I am hopeless. I don't even know why I am on here I do not ever talk about my emotions nor do I ever post on reddit but i'm just so tired I don't know where else to put it... I don't think that I will ever be happy. I don't think I will ever live my life to the fullest. I don't think I'm going to ever change the world or be remembered. I don't think that I will ever amount to anything extraordinary. I don't think I will fulfill the wishes of God or whatever the fuck put me on this earth. I don't think that I will ever love myself. I don't know where else to go.... so I don't go anywhere. I remain here in this stagnant cycle.
test_id_207,"It literally ruins my day before it even starts. I'm so tired of being happy in a dream. Being married, having fun with my friends, having money, and then I wake up.

test_id_211,"I'm just really tired. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't talk about not wanting to exist because people just think I'm suicidal. I think about it a lot, but I'd never actually do it. I know the effect it would have on my family, and I wouldn't wish that on them. I wish I could be selfish in that way, and do something for myself, but I can't let my family feel guilty for something that wasn't their doing. I guess I'm just going to have to settle for the constant urge to fast forward through all this bullshit until I can finally die."

This is the first time I鈥檝e ever received this many 鈥渓ikes鈥� and comments on any social media platform as well as getting any awards here on Reddit. I didn鈥檛 think this would ever happen to me.

Thank you again, I really appreciate everything."
test_id_213,"If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. 

I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk."

Yesterday I decided to be happy. 

Thinking about you all.

Also, to those saying teaching isn鈥檛 easy, no one said that it was easy. Everyone has different personality traits. Please remember this is a post celebrating mental health, and to instill hope in others. 

Edit 2: another very large deciding factor - one of my best friends shot himself in the head on Christmas Eve 2017. The impact is real."
test_id_216,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it."
test_id_217,"I鈥檝e been very depressed and having intrusive thoughts. I had a big panic attack at like 4:30am and no friends were awake to call at that hour, so I went on a limb and I called the suicide hotline.

I told her I have been depressed for a long time, my life, finances, family, job, everything is going terribly. I keep having the thought that it鈥檇 just be easier to end it all. I鈥檝e been abusing alcohol heavily as well. 

She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn鈥檛 seem to help at all so I stopped going.

鈥淯m, you can afford alcohol but you can鈥檛 afford therapy?鈥� She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely. Eventually I hung up.

Yes. I am a mess, lady. That鈥檚 why I called! I left the conversation feeling so much more shitty about myself.

Edit: thank you everyone!"
test_id_218,"J remember i used to be funny. I used to laugh and make jokes. I remember being able to hold a conversation with people. I wanted to know people and give back. I was shy but querky, talkative and funny around people who knew me. 

Now I'm nothing. I don't seem to laugh or smile anymore. 

I feel numb and unsatisfied with everything I do.

EDIT: wow thank you everyone for your responses. I thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that I'm not alone. We just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on. 


On a side note..

I'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but.. I sometimes think part of the reason is I have this intense fear of losing people. So much in fact that i start believing In the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes they'll like me and not leave. I just agree and comply with everything. I've done this for so long I just don't know who I am anymore."
test_id_219,I told my wife yesterday that I have suicidal thoughts sometimes and what I'm doing about it to feel better. Needless to say she went over the top about all the reasons I shouldn't and then went and told my mom without my permission. Guess I'm not telling her anything anymore. I'm in this shit alone.
test_id_220,"I eat 3 healthy meals a day. I exercise. I managed to bring my hours of sleep per night to 6. I make it a point to interact with friends and family at least once a week. I take my meds. I go to therapy. I have done this for more than 2 years rigorously.

And yet I'm still always tired. I still don't enjoy anything. I still feel like the useless little shit I was before. It's just wake up, do my routine, go to sleep, repeat.

I suppose I could reach the other end of life without taking shortcuts like this. But fuck me, is it the best I can ever hope for? To just to sort of keep going? Why should I put in so much work for so little payoff???

Fuck."

test_id_222,"If I had cancer, I could say I needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. I could apply for and receive disability. 

I could freely tell my patients I was gone for 3 months or whatever bc I was doing chemo. 

No one would suggest that I dont need medicine bc Jesus died for my sins. 

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. 

When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. 

Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.

Edit: thanks for all the responses! Let me rephrase something here. I dont wish I had cancer. I wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer. I'm not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes."
test_id_223,"I just woke up an hour ago. I don't know why, but I always really struggle with Christmas. I started getting so sad that it was getting hard to breathe.

Thank god my brother came in with the puppy and it snapped me out of it a bit.

Hope everyone is safe today."
test_id_224,"A while ago I got into an argument with a guy because he implied that I was immature for complaining about being in college. He said, ""don't forget you're taking up space in a class someone else would love to be taking."" Even before I heard that, I felt like I was a waste of space and resources, but that of all things just made it so much worse somehow. I've wasted pretty much every gift I've been given and all I want is to die in peace but I can't even do that.

test_id_227,"Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better. 
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all."" 
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"". 
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope. 
&nbsp;

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to. 
&nbsp;

r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.

We just want to be heard, I guess. And we understand that about each other. Cheers, everyone. Wish you all the best of getting through your day."
test_id_228,"I hate when people say something along the lines of, 鈥淭his guy got through this, so you鈥檒l be fine.鈥� When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they鈥檇 want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I鈥檓 sure it鈥檚 the same for them. It鈥檚 toxic and it won鈥檛 make someone who鈥檚 depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, 鈥淏eing stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.鈥� Just because the blades smaller doesn鈥檛 mean it doesn鈥檛 hurt. The only reason I鈥檓 posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don鈥檛 know what to say, but I would think they鈥檇 understand it wouldn鈥檛 make it any better just because some other guy had it worse.

While yes it can bring someone who鈥檚 whining about something trivial to perspective, there鈥檚 a line that鈥檚 crossed when you tell something like that to someone who鈥檚 actually going through depression/tough times.

It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don鈥檛 know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless."

My mom is sick (multiple sclerosis) and We can't afford her medication anymore. 


Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... 

I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. 
My father is unemployed too. 

We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted. 

To make it easy to understand our situation , There is no dollars in our country anymore only lebanese money. All our savings in the banks is gone. We became poor. 70% unemployement , everything is expensive ... Imagine Vanezuella but ten times worse .. 

We are stuck in a war between Israel and Hezbollah. We are innocent educated people who speak 3 languages !! I have a license in physical therapy which I got and cost me 25 thousand dollars and it's useless. My father is an accountant who worked so hard and now our savings is gone! There is no fucking dollars anymore! 

I'm doing physiotherapy volunteer work but now it's starting to do more bad for my mental health than good. I'm working 8hours and getting payed 0. I'm angry every morning about this and specially before sleeping

I'm just done. I'm really lost and I can't get out of this country with no savings and if it wasn't for my parents I would have ended my life a long time ago.

test_id_240,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story. As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life."
test_id_241,"I鈥檓 tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I鈥檓 just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. 

I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn鈥檛 me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. 

Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn鈥檛 the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties."

Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.

But I鈥檓 wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I鈥檓 almost 26 and I鈥檓 scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life. 

TLDR: I鈥檓 25 and I feel like I鈥檓 wasting time, which I am. But it鈥檚 so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order. 

It feels so far out of reach"
test_id_243,"Does anybody else feel like they 'are just there'?

I feel like there is no depth to me. I have no interests anymore, everything feels like a chore. I don't feel like a real person, only a spectator - I am here, but not really. I have no personality. I pick up some traits I see in others, or on TV. I feel like I am just a mix of various people I've considered interesting, and I just impersonate and mimic them. I just live and do what others want me to do. I feel like an empty shell. I daydream all the time, and sometimes feel like I am losing touch with reality. Sometimes I can't recall what my face looks like, all I see are parts of it, and it feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable. 

I have no idea what is going on with me. I've been growing more and more suicidal each day. I just wish I could feel okay for a moment."
test_id_244,"She really said it best:

鈥淒ead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude.鈥�

God damn, am I sick of being alive. I鈥檓 29 and really can鈥檛 envision another 60 years of wanting to hurt myself, feeling like no one gives a fuck and hoping I die in some type of accident."
test_id_245,"It isn't quite like ""wanting to die"" but more like ""not wanting to live"", has anyone been overwhelmed by this feeling as well?"
test_id_246,"Every day when I wake up, I feel suuuuper depressed for the first few hours of being up. For the rest of the day it comes and goes but it鈥檚 every morning without fail."
test_id_247,"Not that I want to kill myself right this instant but it feels like it's too late to prevent it. Something bad is going to happen later on down the line and then I'll just end it. There's no way around it so long as I don't die suddenly in a car crash or something. I feel like I'm one of those people who just never gets better.

Edit: why did this post blow up this was just a depressive vent post

Edit 2: why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes

Edit 3: I feel like I should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience. My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now. This is why I feel that suicide is inevitable for me personally."
test_id_248,"That鈥檚 the scariest/most pathetic thought that runs through my brain on work nights. I hate this world I live in. I hate being so alone all of the time. 


**I wish with all of my being there was a simple way out.**"
test_id_249,"I laugh at it now after all these years. I had seen it on TV that someone committed suicide by od. All it did I think was give me an upset stomach. I'm 27 now. Honestly surprised I'm still here. I've been feeling very suicidal the past couple of days. The only thing that stops me is my baby brother I take care of everyday. When he goes home though, I don't know. I just hope my mood is better by then. I know part of me doesn't want to die but the feeling is so forceful and impulsive."
test_id_250,"I鈥檓 fed up of waiting on other people. It鈥檚 clear nobody really gives a shit about me.

So sod it. I鈥檓 going to go and do my own thing. No help from anyone. I鈥檝e gone this long being a loner I鈥檒l just accept it鈥檚 my life. I鈥檓 going to adopt a do or die attitude and this will end either with me ending myself or something beautiful. I鈥檓 going to apply for every job under the sun. I鈥檓 going to write this book I鈥檝e been putting off. I鈥檓 going to claw my way out of debt.

Wish me luck my friends 馃挀 I have nothing left to lose."
test_id_251,"Because i cannot bring myself to focus on things i could do normally before, be it hobbies, watching movies, reading, and so on. All i feel is lying down all day and doing nothing.

edit: mixed feelings with the responses ive been reading. Sucks to hear that I am not alone with experiencing this. I just hope that some day, some miracle might happen to our lives and bring back the spark we once lost."
test_id_252,"instead of called in from work or breaking down during my shift i cry on the drive to work.
instead of ranting on instagram or ranting on facebook i cry myself to sleep.
instead of telling people how i feel, i say im fine and smile knowing no one could understand how fucked iam.
instead of threating to kill myself, ive come to terms with the fact that i'll be gone soon once i get to my breaking point and end it all."
test_id_253,"It does not even have to be a major incident, but that tenuous grasp you had on climbing out of the hole, that little bit of hope that things are starting to turn around, suddenly releases and you are plummet back into the pit; and now you are too damn tired to try climbing out again ..."
test_id_254,I feel so empty. to the point that things i used to laugh at i no longer find amusing. Call me a coward but ive never told anyone about the way i feel maybe in order to be able to carry on with life with no more complications. I just want someone to hold me close and tell me its going to be ok. I guess this is my cry for help.
test_id_255,It hurts realizing that your not this deep down to earth interesting smart person. Realizing you just a piece of trash that is useless. It doesnt matter wether im here or not. It just breaks my heart to realize that.
test_id_256,"I think of a name, a face, a place, a year鈥攖he only things I can recollect are negative. I鈥檒l just be driving in the car or sitting in my room, then these thoughts hit me like a fucking locomotive: 鈥淩emember that stupid weird shit you said 6 years ago?鈥� Or 鈥渞emember that group of people whom you tried to befriend earlier in freshman year of college only to be rejected, and you didn鈥檛 really care for them much anyways but holy fuck, you are so dysfunctional and weird and retarded?鈥� It goes on, 鈥渞emember how you chose to not talk to that cute girl who showed clear-as-the-fucking-day signs of interest in you but still opted to not talk to because you鈥檙e that brain dead and insecure?鈥�
It doesn鈥檛 stop. It never fucking does. It鈥檚 like I鈥檓 haunted by my relatively uneventful past. I involuntarily think of these social/romantic/academic/attention-deficit/practical failures, and then I think of how great it would be if I could just roll over and die, never mind how. No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I鈥檓 tired, I鈥檓 tired of being tired, and I鈥檓 tired of being tired of being. I鈥檓 not suicidal, yet at the same time, I feel like I鈥檓 just one bad day from doing myself in; however, I could never do that to my friends and family. It鈥檚 a weird fucking feeling. I don鈥檛 normally post here... Thanks for coming to my TED Talk on Stupid Bullshit.

test_id_257,"The only real option. The only button that ends eternal pain and suffering. Fade away from everywhere and become nothingness. All your sorrows and misery, agony gone in the blink of an eye. And you know what's the best part? It's free! You don't need to pay to kill yourself, but you need to pay to live. It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out. It's not much, we all die at some point wouldn't hurt to cut myself off from everything as I would lose my consciousness. 

But I am here to live for the mental well being of other people, so they don't be sad. I suffer for them. Yet they wouldn't take a minute to listen to one of those millions of thoughts I have ruining my head. Ironic."

I have no proper education, no friends, no job, no travel experience, no positive memories, no good relationships with anyone, no confidence, no productive hobbies, no self worth, and no future.

I'm worthless trash at the peak of my youth. The people I grew up with are pursuing their dream careers and traveling the world, enjoying their lives. I am sat here taking care of my needy family, looking for pathetic jobs, and engaging in escapism to forget that I am who I am.

I am 25 years old this year, a stupid idiot, a weak coward, a life loser, and a complete waste of space"

I have nothing planned, I just think about it all the time. Why is this?"
test_id_265,"I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression."
test_id_266,"Everyone says 鈥渢ry harder鈥� or 鈥淚 know you can do it鈥� and all I wanna say to them is shut the living fuck up. I can鈥檛 try harder and I can鈥檛 do it, if I could I obviously would. I know they care but they鈥檙e also being inconsiderate by assuming I鈥檓 just choosing to fail my classes. I鈥檝e been struggling with depression for a few years, I feel the lowest I鈥檝e ever felt right now.

test_id_267,"Yesterday I went to a clinic because of my injured leg. While I was talking to my doctor about my injury, suddenly I had an urge to talk about what I鈥檝e been feeling for the past 5 years. It took a lot of courage since I never talked to any adults about it because I was too anxious and scared. I cried, my hands were shaking and I couldn鈥檛 really talk properly but what I knew was I finally seek a proper treatment. I knew I was depressed and the doctor diagnosed me with it. I鈥檓 only 18 years old this year and I鈥檓 currently studying at college right now. I鈥檓 embarrassed when I remember the way I broke down in front of the doctor. But I did. I finally talked."

She was my angel and she was helping me so much with my anxiety and depression and now she is just gone. She always tried to make me happy. She was always there for me.

I was with her for 2 years now and now i'm just alone. Nobody is with me. My mom and dad both hate me. I don't even have friends or something. I dont want to leave my home, i dont want to eat, i don't want to drink. I just want my girl back.

test_id_274,"Does anyone else feel like they have no personality because of depression? For me the downward spiral started when I was 11 or so, so being depressed is basically all I remember. I don't know who I was before that, or who I am now. 

I always just feel like a carbon copy of whatever person I'm talking to, putting on a fitting mask and trying to please them with the personality I fake for them. I can't, for the life of me, tell you a single characteristic of me, except for my anxiety and depression. 

When I'm alone, I tend to talk to myself (probably out of loneliness and the longing for actual human interaction, and yeah I know it's weird) and then I feel like a blanc slate. Like there's nothing to me. 

This is my first ever post on reddit and I'm extremely anxious about it, but I've wanted to tell this to someone for such a long time and now I found this sub."

test_id_276,"When I feel ok, I feel off. When I sink into a depressive mindset, in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied.

Keeping up communication is rough sometimes. A day of not replying to a message can become a week when you don't know how to explain that you just couldn't be around people that day, which can become a month when it always seems impossible to reach out and explain where you've been.

I don't know where I'm going with this post, I just needed to vent that out. I had the day off from work and I spent it in bed, scrolling through the same few apps.

Idk just feels like i鈥檓 trapped.

test_id_288,"I used to be quite a bright kid, at least, according to what everyone said. After years of trauma and abuse, however, depression completely overcame my life, and after so long, I feel it has utterly destroyed my brain; fried it, like an overloaded computer. I genuinely forget how old I am sometimes. I struggle doing basic math. My short-term memory has deteriorated to nothing. Etc. I just feel as though I'm slowing down only more each passing day. If I can ever beat depression, would I have any hope of restoring my cognitive ability at all?"
test_id_289,"I just want to turn the clock back 10 years and redo everything, and right all the wrongs. Now I can't, too late and too much.

Edit (05/24/2020): I did read all the comments, thank you. This thought of regrets have tortured me so much: a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me. In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle."
test_id_290,I would like to hear your thoughts.
test_id_291,Yup... that鈥檚 me. I think this is the depression that completely scares me most because days pass and I don鈥檛 do anything at all and don鈥檛 accomplish anything because I don鈥檛 give a fuck and then I look back and so much time has gone to waste
test_id_292,"Ever since my first suicidal thoughts when I was like 14 (22 now) people say ""aren't you so thankful you're still here?""



No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?


I'm not thankful for it. Jesus Christ do I wish I had just killed myself 8 years ago or *any* time since. I've never once been thankful for not killing myself"

test_id_294,"No real reason for posting I鈥檓 just proud of myself for making the choice I did.
Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don鈥檛 want to stress people out. I鈥檓 honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I鈥檒l slowly get to each comment as I can 馃槉. Firstly the cost- I鈥檓 an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can鈥檛 believe some people have to pay. I wouldn鈥檛 have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn鈥檛 trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn鈥檛 help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I鈥檝e had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don鈥檛 do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it鈥檚 referred to bulk billing. Basically it鈥檚 free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn鈥檛 been able to renew as my new doctor couldn鈥檛 fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven鈥檛 meet her yet, but basically she鈥檒l contact me regularly to see if I鈥檓 ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I鈥檓 struggling too. I鈥檝e nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward."

test_id_297,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he鈥檚 screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he鈥檚 done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?"
test_id_298,"Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10. I would have this feeling inside me like emptiness and I didn't realise until I was an adult that this was depression when this feeling came back."

I'm tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today. Every fucking day. I'm tired of feeling like crying everyday all day everyday.

test_id_307,"I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

test_id_312,"Hello.

Ever since I was little, I've been very emotional. As time has passed and I've been able to understand better the world around me, I find disgust. I dislike how everything is money and manipulation and how you can't do anything if you don't play along. My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot.

I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore. 


Thanks for getting until the end."

Waiting for their classes to finish so you can see them, spending time together in between lessons, studying with each other, catching the bus together then doing it again the next day"
test_id_315,"I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

**EDIT 2: I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments... I truly don't know what to say.

Just... thank you, everyone. For helping me feel a bit less alone.**

**EDIT 3: Well... I don't know what to say. I was okay for a few days after posting this. Now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again. They just... are. Every single time I think I'll get better, and then nothing at all.**

test_id_316,"I just want to stop existing, no one would have any memories of me, nor feel sad as they wouldn't have known me.

test_id_317,"I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses."

Edit 2: I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed.

test_id_320,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol."

My heart hurts so much but I鈥檓 such a glutton for punishment that I can鈥檛 bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I鈥檒l try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C鈥檚 in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying 鈥渨ell Don鈥檛 choke him (insert name)鈥� and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying 鈥淚鈥檓 not choking him鈥� I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I鈥檓 an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I鈥檓 going to get my ass beat I鈥檓 going to get my ass beat. I鈥檓 just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I鈥檓 concerned we probably won鈥檛 ever speak again. Let鈥檚 start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to 鈥渨ake him up after rugrats鈥� when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you鈥檙e 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn鈥檛 air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don鈥檛 remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there鈥檚 my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he鈥檚 in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse 鈥渋sn鈥檛 this okay because it鈥檚 what dad used to do to us. 鈥� of course having a criminal record he couldn鈥檛 find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she鈥檚 gone it鈥檒l look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it鈥檚 not full time and 鈥渁t your age your brother worked full time鈥� at my age y鈥檃ll gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It鈥檚 just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it鈥檚 a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I鈥檓 always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn鈥檛 want to help which wasn鈥檛 an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded 鈥渇orget it鈥� and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother鈥檚 defense I鈥檓 a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don鈥檛 want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn鈥檛 take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn鈥檛 even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn鈥檛 want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don鈥檛 show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said 鈥渨e don鈥檛 know if we鈥檒l need you tomorrow or not yet鈥� so I just didn鈥檛 bother to show up because if y鈥檃ll needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn鈥檛 going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn鈥檛 even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up 鈥渨hy should I have to explain to my boss why you didn鈥檛 come鈥� 鈥渨hy do you get to sleep all day while we work I鈥檓 sick of it鈥� turning to my mother 鈥淚鈥檓 sick of him aren鈥檛 y鈥檃ll sick of him鈥� (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won鈥檛 ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I鈥檓 running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I鈥檓 pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don鈥檛 care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn鈥檛. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn鈥檛 despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said 鈥渨ell he wasn鈥檛 here for Christmas so I had to make it special.鈥� I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I鈥檓 lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She鈥檚 talking some I can鈥檛 I don鈥檛 have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn鈥檛 want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I鈥檓 super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don鈥檛 know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn鈥檛 loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of 鈥測ou鈥檙e allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation鈥� to which he responds (talking out of his ass) 鈥渨ell you didn鈥檛 pay for it mom did!鈥� Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there鈥檚 not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I鈥檓 in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I鈥檓 literally holding onto grudges that I don鈥檛 know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I鈥檓 positive she鈥檚 forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I鈥檓 exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes 鈥渁re you ready now I鈥檓 not in a rush or anything鈥� I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I鈥檒l admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I鈥檓 ready to go lol. Otherwise I鈥檇 still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she鈥檚 overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I鈥檓 almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It鈥檚 been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I鈥檓 just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of 鈥測ou鈥檙e in a bad mood because I asked you to take me鈥� my response being 鈥渙h what I鈥檓 in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???鈥� which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don鈥檛 understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don鈥檛 care if they鈥檙e right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I鈥檓 not mad and you tell me 鈥測es you are mad that鈥檚 why you鈥檙e being shitty鈥� that鈥檚 a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you鈥檙e just going to decide I鈥檓 in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I鈥檓 in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying 鈥淚 hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me鈥�. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I鈥檓 inside of it, I hope it鈥檚 something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won鈥檛 be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn鈥檛 kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don鈥檛 care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn鈥檛 at fault for but still it鈥檚 a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn鈥檛 want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he鈥檚 cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn鈥檛 literally crying 鈥渕ommy bail me out鈥� when he鈥檚 in there. As he鈥檚 going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me 鈥測our ashtray is knocked over 鈥� as if i wasn鈥檛 outside and heard him kick it over like I鈥檓 supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of 鈥渋f he needs an ashtray he鈥檒l have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.鈥� Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. 鈥淲ell it is your ashtray...鈥� okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that鈥檚 the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she鈥檚 the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don鈥檛 want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I鈥檝e been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn鈥檛 working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don鈥檛 feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don鈥檛 really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I鈥檓 chasing my mother鈥檚 approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It鈥檚 only been recently that I鈥檓 starting to come around to my father and that鈥檚 only because I think I鈥檓 starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I鈥檝e been and all that I鈥檝e been given. But I don鈥檛 know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that鈥檚 not to say I鈥檓 perfect either. I鈥檝e caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that鈥檚 neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that鈥檚 where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it鈥檚 just who you are and can鈥檛 be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn鈥檛 sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing 鈥渄octor鈥� with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That鈥檚 fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn鈥檛 ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn鈥檛 the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don鈥檛 remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn鈥檛 have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that鈥檚 my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That鈥檚 probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn鈥檛 till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here鈥檚 the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I鈥檓 talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I鈥檝e catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn鈥檛 me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we鈥檙e so sorry don鈥檛 even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn鈥檛 only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn鈥檛 care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That鈥檚 another one that鈥檚 my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I鈥檝e thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I鈥檓 desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I鈥檓 tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I鈥檓 starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don鈥檛 think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don鈥檛 turn them into jokes. I鈥檒l let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don鈥檛 want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I鈥檓 a scumbag. I鈥檓 starting to think my family is scumbags, and I鈥檓 genuinely losing my will to live. I鈥檝e been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don鈥檛 know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow."
test_id_325,"There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on."
test_id_326,"might sound messed up but at least I'd lose weight and be pretty for once

but instead i keep stuffing my face with fast and sugary foods to feel happy for at least few seconds :/ where did my discipline go"
test_id_327,Everyone speaking with each other happy and laughing I watch and feel like it's best not to join in it's not like I'll make a difference and I wouldn't make anything better
test_id_328,"Now I'm not in school, can barley make rent, have no friends, family gave up on me. It's sad. It really is a travesty"
test_id_329,"I鈥檒l be fine at one moment and then I Just start feeling really down and all my inner demon voices start filling my thoughts. For example last night I was watching a movie with my BF we decided to stay in order pizza, have microwave popcorn and all that jazz. BUT I noticed that he kept checking his phone and I started automatically assuming that he鈥檚 probably flirting on IG. I don鈥檛 even have proof and my mood changed super quick. I became sad and super insecure. I feel like my retroactive jealously gets really bad at times too which leads to my depression. I went to bed crying and woke up sad and angry feeling like I鈥檓 a piece of shit. I hate it. Does anyone else suffer of mini episodes like this?"
test_id_330,"After years of struggling with depression and anxiety I've noticed I can't concentrate and process information as fast as I used to.

Does anybody else feel like this?"
test_id_331,"""where do you see yourself in 5 years ? "" 

""what do you want to do later ?"" 

""what are your projects ?"" 

I hate these questions. Because I can't see any lights in my future, only pain, stupidity and failure.

When people tell me these questions, I just look at them stupidly, because I can't reply ""in a grave, or maybe in a river, maybe the streets ? I have no idea""

These questions hurts, because it make me realize how much a failure I am, and how meaningless and absurd life is. I don't know. I wish I knew what I want to do, but I don't know.

I just want to stop this mess."
test_id_332,"It鈥檚 such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It鈥檚 like I鈥檓 a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don鈥檛 want to deal with any of it. 

It鈥檚 incredibly destructive but I honestly can鈥檛 help myself, as I鈥檓 too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I鈥檓 like a completely different person. Spooky."
test_id_333,I cant anymore i really can't i feel like a real failure right now i even failed at killing myself about an hour ago lol kinda ironic i dont know what to do now or how to feel or operate next i feel so useless and i cant literally speaking i cant look my mother in the face right i just keep crying i guess i dont even now what im trying to get from writing this its just i feel really low right now i guess
test_id_334,"All day I have my headphones on, I even sleep with them because sleeping otherwise is impossible. My family hates that I do this and everyday I can hear them complain about my disinterest in everything. Can't even blame them, nobody likes people who are basically broken pieces glued together by a pair of headphones and a sound."
test_id_335,"My parents don't understand how I could be so lazy that I never want to heat up any of my food to make it taste better -- I just think the difference in taste isn't a big enough reward for the amount of effort it takes. Similarly, grooming does not seem worth it at all unless I have to go somewhere (and even then, sometimes I just put a hat on and call it a day). I just wish my brain would reward me with happy chemicals for getting shit done, the way it's supposed to, because it feels like every day I just wake up and wait for the day to be over already."
test_id_336,Good quote by Robin Williams. Story of my life basically. I'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head.
test_id_337,"While cuddling of course. 

Edit 1: I fucking love all of you

Edit 2: So many people in the US, no one is down under :("
test_id_338,"If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life.

I鈥檓 a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG鈥檚 than I did with my family. 

I鈥檓 not close with my family and I don鈥檛 ever will be because they are toxic af. I鈥檝e been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can鈥檛 stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone鈥檚 feelings. 

School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don鈥檛 even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it鈥檚 not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then.

Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don鈥檛 blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn鈥檛 much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn鈥檛 I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My 鈥渇riend鈥� saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade: I鈥檝e never been so lonely. 10th grade: My existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. I don鈥檛 want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can鈥檛 even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? 

Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don鈥檛 know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I鈥檝e overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don鈥檛 understand why people just won鈥檛 help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don鈥檛 to be homeless especially at this because it鈥檚 insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I鈥檓 having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it鈥檚 the 鈥渁nswer鈥� to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me 

鈥� Thank you for reading. I鈥檓 grateful to whoever took the time out to read this. Sorry it was long.


Edit- I really want to thank all of you for the kind words. Really I do. I wish I can meet all of you and you guys hugs because I was feeling lonely and felt the need to share I full story, but I didn鈥檛 expect this much feedback. I鈥檓 really grateful for all for this community and all you who react out 鉂わ笍."
test_id_339,Memory has gone to shit. I can't concentrate on anything. Feeling is hard to explain but it's like I'm driving a car from the back seat.
test_id_340,"I go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive. I am constantly worried about something going wrong. Lack focus and passion for what I do professionally and have no confidence in anything. I feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig. Toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues"
test_id_341,I always felt that I could have been something way better than I am now. I am barely scrapping by and spend most of my time in bed often daydreaming about how things could have gone for me if I had done things differently.
test_id_342,"I need a new inspection sticker for my car, the time has come to renew my driver's license, I need to do my bi weekly wash of my car, I need to order contact lenses I'm almost out, gotta go cut my grandma's grass, my room is getting messy need to clean my room, I need to get more cat food, oh my cat chewed through my USB charging cable I need to buy a new cable asap, I need to write out and send out the checks for water and electric, I need to put together a budget so I can start tracking my finances....oh it's been 90 days since I logged into by bank so I actually have to call the bank and speak to a representative to access my online banking, I'm way past due seeing a dentist, also need to see a doctor because of a weird lump that hasn't gone away, I ran out of juice for my vape I need to make a trip to the vape shop, my dad needs me to come over to help him because he can't get his Internet to work

All on top of a mentally and spiritually crushing 40 hour work week that leaves me with only a few hours of personal time to and energy to get this tasks done, a job that barely pays enough to get by that sucks the souls out of me

An endless wave after wave crashing into me, just to sustain basic human life and fulfill my obligations in society

I'm fucking tired, I don't enjoy this, I didn't ask for this...when can I simply sit down and relax or god forbid enjoy something in life... surely I'm not the only one that feels this way?

I am ready for the void"
test_id_343,"Every single day I feel like I want to die.

I'm tired of feeling useless and having no real talents.

My drive to achieve any goals has faded.

A part of me doesn't want to care about being successful

The rat race is driving me crazy.

I've been fired from almost every job I've had.

Even the job I had with someone in my family.

They told me I had too many mental problems.

Everyday I watch my family go to jobs they hate and spend most of their free time sleeping.

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company.

Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me.

When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time.

So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome.

My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have.

Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment.

If anyone read this I will be surprised.

God please help me !

Thinking about taking the Zoloft that I was prescribed a few months ago. I have a doctors appointment in a couple weeks but I'm thinking about taking this Zoloft again.

\*EDIT\* 

I'd love to wander away and travel around but I'm stuck on the methadone clinic because of bad choices I've made in the past. I'm on a fairly low does and plan to get off one day. The routine of going to the clinic every morning is driving me crazy \*EDIT\*

test_id_344,"Nobody鈥檚 life is perfect of course but fuck. How do people just not get depressed in life? Nothing particularly bad happened to me but I鈥檓 becoming closer and more ready to ending it all

Edit: I didn鈥檛 expect this to resonate with as many people as it did. I鈥檓 sorry everyone who has to go through this as well"
test_id_345,"There is not much else to me I guess

Edit: Thank you everyone for all your comments. I鈥檓 tired of fighting but it鈥檚 still nice to know that I鈥檓 not alone."
test_id_346,"I'll admit that even years ago I wasn't very happy and had problems, but I still miss the way I was back then. I still had things that made me happy, hobbies I enjoyed. And I actually had the motivation to do them! I could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while. Now I can't find the motivation to do anything.

But I think most of all I miss how hopeful I was. Despite everything I fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. And I've lost that completely. I don't have any hope anymore, I don't have any motivation, I don't have anything to look forward to. And I just really fucking miss that part of me"
test_id_347,"It really is a horrible combo. I was raised to believe that there was no room for mistakes, that I won't always have someone to help me. Now, everytime something goes wrong, my entire sense of worth just leaves me.
I've been told that I'm talented at a few things, particularly writing. Yet, if I was actually talented, I wouldn't be having so much trou le with my manuscript. Mistakes literally cripple me, and make me not want do anything. For me, not trying is better than trying and failing.
EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger."
test_id_348,"I'm so happy right now I completed my BA degree and I got a high mark for it overall. Those nights I stayed up paid off and I pushed through despite everything happening in my life. It was all worth it, I seriously doubted myself so many times but I did way better than I thought I would.

EDIT: Thanks for the support everyone I really appreciate it :)"
test_id_349,Its true. I may be alive but I'm not living. At this point I'm just surviving. I perished many years ago and now I'm just here.
test_id_350,"its hard to explain but its a feeling of not wanting the pain but wanting it at the same time, i feel like depression is very comforting, even though its not supposed to be, can anyone give me ideas on what this is?"
test_id_351,"Growing up I never thought about it like that. I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn鈥檛 happy was some outcast. Now I see happiness really is a privilege, and I don鈥檛 say this in spite. If you are happy, that鈥檚 amazing, but also I think there are a lot of people who don鈥檛 realize how lucky they are to be happy. It truly boggles my mind that there are people who go to bed excited for the next day, it鈥檚 a feeling I don鈥檛 think I can remember having, at least for a very very long time."
test_id_352,I feel like they would run away or be disappointed once they get to know me. What the fuck am I going to do with myself? Maybe I'll doe alone lol
test_id_353,"As a quiet person who's dealt with many mental health issues, and is generally stuck inside my own head, I enjoy being quiet, observing a lot, and not being a socially obnoxious twat who feels the need to speak just because. Why do people act like being quiet is a weird thing? Just annoys the hell out of me and makes me instantly dislike the person, that's all rant over."
test_id_354,"i'm a really short guy, with an ugly face if I grow out my facial hair I look like a sick dog

i'm balding, my hair is thin 

my body is weak and scrawny, also my dick is small

everytime I catch my reflection on the subway I just want to vomit

I'M 27 but I look 47, also a KHV but this one goes without saying

people don't even see me, nobody can handle my no personality and social retardation

this is so unfair, and yes I wish I was born if africa at least I would've died at 8"
test_id_355,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you."
test_id_356,"I can't use my mind in the way that it used to work. I can't think too strongly. I can't think too deeply. I am a shell of my former self. It hurts to use my brain. I have no strength for patience and doing what I want to. I am weak. I escaped depression, but I am weak..

Edit: So many beautiful comments. Thank you all for sharing. I love this community as it's very insightful and you don't quite feel as alone as you may think you are."
test_id_357,"I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed."
test_id_358,Like every morning I think oh fuck this again. I can鈥檛 do this.
test_id_359,"My girlfriend for 7,5 years just dumped me because 鈥渋ts hard to live with somebody that is always depressed鈥� and because she has more intrest in another man.
This is probably the closest ive ever gotten to ending my own life.
I just dont see why i should continue.

Edit: thanks for all of the kind words, i really do appriciate them.
Right now, about 6 hours after it happend i still feel like my world had ended and that i wanne end it all.
I鈥檝e been trying to do something to keep my mind busy but everything that i do atm, makes me think of her.
I will be fine someday i hope.

Edit edit: i wanne thank everybody who commented,liked, private messaged, and awarded.
When i saw her leave and i knew I couldn鈥檛 call her mine anymore i really really wanted to die, i was close to do something i would regret.
I still have those feelings but thanks to everybody here im sure im not gonna act up on those thoughts.
Please everybody when my post faded away, keep helping people in this sub the way you helped me.

P.s. stop making me cry every time."
test_id_360,"What I mean is that I constantly worry that I'm not actually depressed, that I'm just lazy and don't want to take the next step in life, that I don't want to put in the work to get where I know I want to be.
So I'm wondering if anyone relates to that"

test_id_363,"I used to be so smart, at the top of my class. I had so much promise. But now I struggle with basic human functions and social interactions. Depression has made is so hard for me to focus on anything be it school, work, or even just taking care of myself. 

I feel like my mind is stuck in the past just replaying all the regrets and failures of my lifetime this leaving no room for any new information, new skills, or new ambitions. It's like a mold festering over mind, slowly shutting off parts of my brain untill I'm braindead with no option but to end it. does anyone relate?"
test_id_364,"I just want to go away into nature with my girlfriend and just enjoy life together instead of being stuck with my toxic family and having to work for 20-30 years just to save up money to retire
also shallow people who only care about the things they own, appearance and pleasure - they make me feel sick for whatever reason"
test_id_365,"I鈥檝e hidden it for nearly 9 years, obviously I鈥檓 good at hiding how I鈥檓 truly feeling. So stop assuming I鈥檓 magically better."
test_id_366,"I'll start by saying this : Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me. Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. Especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend. 
Anyway thanks for reading... What about you?

EDIT : Thank you everyone for replying, each and every one of you. I haven't answered to everybody. Sometimes I don't know what to say but I have read all the comments, I love you all.

test_id_367,"Am I the only one who hates to hear this? I really hate it, like thanks a huge bunch for once again reminding me of how useless I am.

test_id_368,I would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes I wish something else would just do the job for me.
test_id_369,"Because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. 

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us: a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time."
test_id_370,So I鈥檝e felt with depression for about 10 years now and it鈥檚 always so confusing when I push people away but still want them to care for me. Instead of going out and doing things with my friends I鈥檒l stay at home and cry. Instead of reaching out to people I鈥檒l think about how they probably hate me. Whenever I try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all I鈥檓 doing is complaining. I鈥檓 just so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone else feel like this? And if you have do you have any advice for me?

test_id_373,"Go WHERE? I don鈥檛 like bars. I don鈥檛 like to drink too much. Especially if I鈥檓 driving. Where else do people go to socialize?? I don鈥檛 have friends or even know where to go to make friends. 

I try every opportunity I get it but I don鈥檛 get many opportunities because I have NO idea where to go socialize. 

I鈥檓 just sick and tired of being alone 24/7 and feeling completely hopeless to change it. This makes me sad as fuck. :/"
test_id_374,"It's that depression doesn't kill you desire to want to do things, it doesn't kill your dreams and what you want in life, it just stops you from doing them. It's like being in a cage and outside the bars you can see all the things you can do and want to do but the cage (depression) locks you in and stops you from getting at them and doing them. I dunno but to me that's one of the worst things about it :p"
test_id_375,"Hey guys, so.. i don't actually know how to tell this, i won't bore you with the whole story. basically, some months ago, i wake up because of my girlfriends phone, it was her gym coach who, i found out, she was having sex with. i stare at the phone in disbelief, i couldn't believe it. and now that? i woke my girlfriend up, yell at her, and ask her to leave.

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

I wish i could hug my mother in this situation."
test_id_376,"I know that this will blend into all of the other messages on here and soon be forgotten, I just feel the need to put these words out there.

test_id_389,"Why do I feel even more inhuman when I'm with others?

I don't want to talk, I don't want to smile. I don't want one of my friends to listen. I'm sick and tired of speaking, of explaining.




Whenever I'm alone, I might have moments of sadness, but I also moments of joy.



When I'm with others, I forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like I am caught to spend time with them.




I don't want people to occupy me or make me happy.

I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. 


And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way.





I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want.



It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. 


Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.




If your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine.



You have to see what's wrong and adjust it.
And right now, every form of human interaction feels like I'm doing a marathon with that leg..."

I鈥檓 not super happy and slightly frustrated over something? Friend says 鈥渨hy are you so snappy lately鈥� or 鈥渨hat do you expect me to do鈥�. Nothing. I just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong.

Is depression the main factor for something like this?"

test_id_398,It may just be the depression talking but I seriously think that there is more bad than good in this life we live.
test_id_399,"I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)"
test_id_400,"This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love."
test_id_401,"Recently I think I鈥檝e been okay. Not super happy, but not completely down in the dumps, but ever since about a week ago, I鈥檝e been getting passive suicidal thoughts. If you don鈥檛 know what that is, it鈥檚 when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it. This has happened every day. Even this morning, my first thought when getting out of bed was 鈥淚 should just die鈥� These thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what I have to do during the day, which makes me feel useless, which makes me think about suicide. It鈥檚 an endless fucking cycle and I hate it."
test_id_402,I care so much what people think about me. Little things are a big deal to me and I鈥檓 tired of everyone telling me to stop being so sensitive because I can鈥檛 just stop.

test_id_403,"Every now and then I start to feel a little bit optimistic about everything. I start to have all these ideas about how I will change things around and become a better person etc. Just to find that the morning after I'm as depressed as ever, if not more. It's like my depression is sometimes giving me a break just to come back and say ""Psyche! You still suck."""
test_id_404,"Yesterday I played video games with my best friend all evening, and afterwards I laid in bed still sometimes laughing about the things we did earlier.

I love this dog."
test_id_406,"It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable. You KNOW they'll most likely use you as a pillar for support and when you promise them that you'll never leave you give them false hope that crashes down on them twice as hard because of that promise. It's just a fucking cruel thing to do."
test_id_407,"I hate that phrase, and I mark anyone who uses it as a fake who doesn鈥檛 actually give a shit other than to make themselves feel better for trying to 鈥渉elp鈥�

As someone who is depressed suicide isn鈥檛 an option on the table for me yet, but when it comes to it the only thing I鈥檓 gonna hear or read if someone says that to me is that it鈥檚 a 鈥淪olution鈥�

Edit: Sorry. The phrase is 鈥淪uicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem鈥�

Doesn鈥檛 change anything I just said though."
test_id_408,"i used to be so outgoing and carefree. i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all - like, i didnt really know what that was, and i hadn't really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues. i didnt overanalyse and overthink. i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time. i genuinely used to be fine, and now im not so much. if i sit for a while and actually, genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now. and occasionally i'll get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays. and it makes me so sad

test_id_409,"I hate this, I hear it here and there and my blood starts boiling every time.

No, everything in life that happens isnt somehow okay because ""oh you've learned from it.""

I'm not stronger because of my trauma, I am strong inspite of it. 

Me living with depression, going through different trauma, trying to kill myself twice and everything in between hasnt made me stronger, I would gladly not have gone through these things. 

This rant was sponsored by me being pissed.

Glad you are alive.

SIDENOTE: If you find comfort in those words then good for you, I don't mean to take away from that, its just my personal opinion."
test_id_410,"At least for me I鈥檝e hated how people say something like 鈥渙h that person isn鈥檛 actually depressed, it鈥檚 just for attention.鈥�

I don鈥檛 understand the whole complex between depression and attention but I do know nothing feels worse than being in a depressive episode and having nobody to talk to. 

Maybe it stems from that.

All I want is my best friend back.
For us to have real conversations again.

Too bad I have self sabotaging tendencies but that鈥檚 a story for another day.

I just don鈥檛 want to feel completely alone anymore.

Update:
I never expected so many people to resonate with this. Thanks for all the awards and support on this post. It makes me feel slightly better that I鈥檓 not alone in this. I hope everyone had a good Valentine鈥檚 Day!"
test_id_411,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

Thanks again you are great!

test_id_412,"I mean myself personally. Whenever I feel down I automatically start shaming myself by saying I'm only acting like this because I want someone else to feel bad for me. But I know that's not what I want, or at least I think it's not what I want. IDK. Does anyone else ever feel like this though?"
test_id_413,"I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on.

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

Love used to be my hope, my north star. But in the words of ""Daughters"", LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. And the reason it's disgusting is because it's the trick that continues to propagate this cursed existence."
test_id_414,"It could be over the smallest thing. Whenever I hear someone talk about hobbies or anything I am just envious of them. I wish I could enjoy things, I wish I could actually have the desire to do anything. It hurts.

test_id_416,"before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way.

I was wrong.

My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

I used to be so good. Kind to others, excelled my studies, can connect with anyone.

I feel so tired of keeping up the mask. I can't carry on their expectation. Even if i want to, I can't handle it."

test_id_418,"Since this pandemic began, I've been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial, cringy stuff I did when I was a kid. Even though I realize how ridiculous this is, my mind still convinces me I am a terrible person, worthless and undeserving of happiness and that I don't deserve to take care of myself. 
This has begun to affect my concentration and I've been losing sleep.

I was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this? Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?

Thank you in advance. I'd be appreciative of any advice I can get ;-;

Edit: Guys, ty, ty, thank you for the support ;-; 鉂わ笍!! I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well, they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of. That being said, starting tomorrow I'll be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better. If that fails, I will seek therapy. Good night guys, I can't thank you enough and I wish you all the best. I appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings

Edit: I'm so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought, honestly I had no idea either! There's some great advice on here guys and I'll make sure to read back on it if I ever start to doubt myself again. I've also saved some of your posts on my phone just as a reminder that I shouldn't be so hard on myself."
test_id_419,Sleeping feels so damn good. I love it more than anything honestly. It feels so good. It feels like a short period of 鈥渄eath鈥� in a way. Where my mind and my brain is 鈥減aralyzed鈥� and it鈥檚 like an escape from this horrible gut wrenching reality. Yesterday I slept for almost 15 hours. I鈥檓 planning on doing it again today. It just feels so fucking good. It鈥檚 the only time my brain will shut the hell up. Sleeping is the next closest thing to death for me. It feels so good
test_id_420,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn鈥檛 seem to give a fuck, I鈥檓 meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she鈥檚 been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we鈥檒l see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don鈥檛 care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It鈥檚 so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who鈥檚 really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it鈥檚 people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I鈥檓 trying to reply to each one but it鈥檚 hard to keep up, so I鈥檓 sorry if I miss yours. Remember鈥攜ou鈥檙e worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

Today I decided to talk. 

I told them about everything and I answered their questions.
After I had talked they told me: ""You don't have the right to feel like that because there are people who are worse off than you.""

I didn't respond.

 They said: ""Oh great now you are trying the silent treatment!""

test_id_430,"So everything is labor in that way. I don't think people who don't have depression truly understand just how uphill it can seem. When everything has to be forced to be done or it just won't get done. It's exhausting and I'm already exhausted.

A good way to describe it would be everything feels like resistance against the depression. Every action I take as a depressed person is actively going against the depression. Have to fight and resist it and not be consumed by it. And it's exhausting. Always feeling that you are pushing up against something and trying to claw your way out instead of just acting freely without the weight of that.

Was just thinking about this and decided to vent about it here. Wondering what others experience, if they experience it, too."

test_id_435,"I just hate everything. I鈥檓 so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I鈥檓 being irritated by almost everything. I just can鈥檛 stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can鈥檛 remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I鈥檓 ok and someone notices I鈥檓 not feeling well, I鈥檒l just say that I鈥檓 tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It鈥檚 not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it鈥檚 all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I鈥檓 worthless. I鈥檓 ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can鈥檛 even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don鈥檛 even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don鈥檛 want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it鈥檚 now or then? But there鈥檚 one thing that鈥檚 preventing me and that is my fear. I鈥檓 scared of death and pain. I鈥檓 scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I鈥檓 such a fucking coward."
test_id_436,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky. If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships."
test_id_437,"My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn鈥檛 go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don鈥檛 even know how I should feel. I don鈥檛 know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn鈥檛 know how to calm myself and they didn鈥檛 know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them."
test_id_438,"Posting this from my second account. 

This year has been the worst of my (26 F) life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I鈥檓 devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fianc茅 left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I鈥檓 in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn鈥檛 going well. 

I鈥檝e stopped talking to friends and told them I鈥檒l talk to them after Christmas. I don鈥檛 feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I鈥檝e stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don鈥檛 sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I鈥檓 a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don鈥檛 see light at the end of the tunnel and I鈥檓 in a lot of pain. 

I鈥檓 not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I鈥檇 be very relieved and I鈥檇 go as far to say... joyful.

Edit: thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. 

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fianc茅 was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy.

test_id_439,"Last therapy session I was explaining to my psychologist about my 'inner Child' (an expression which I hate but it made sense at the time).

test_id_442,"Its like all your thoughts and feelings are intensified. you feel more like shit because you know there鈥檚 people out there that are probably living there best lives. there鈥檚 people going out with there friends, partying, drinking, clubbing, watching movies/shows together, listening to music in there cars and enjoying the vibe with whoever there with, and then there鈥檚 you...inside the house...in a dark room...in your bed...alone...with no one to talk to you...browsing the depression subreddit wondering how so many people feel the same way as you.



edit: wow, didn鈥檛 know this would receive this much support 馃枻. hope you all are doing well !"
test_id_443,"Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem. That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out."

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression).

Sorry about letting the last post get archived. We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that. In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit. 

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us. Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that. The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get. 

* Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort. Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this. Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private. 

* ""I'm here to help"" posts. These are specifically against the rules. 

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support. Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic. You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything. For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons. Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place. 

**Edit:** I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here: We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.

test_id_445,"I feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me."
test_id_447,"Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. 

Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant.

EDIT: God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. 
I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first. 
I hope we all recover and start feeling better soon, you all deserve to be okay. Thanks again to everyone."

But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored. 
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void. 
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life. 
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything. 
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy. 
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over ! 
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice) 
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore. 
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text. 
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Is that just depression in a way ?"
test_id_449,"I feel like I don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. I'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. I can't remember words very well. Sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air. 

EDIT: wow I didn't think this would get so much response! I made this post while I was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important! Now I feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone. I'm sorry you're all feeling the same way, I know how hard it is. Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.

I truly don't think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it. We just have to recognise that it's this horrible disease doing it to us. I wish I could hug each one of you individually <3"
test_id_450,I don鈥檛 deserve this life
test_id_451,"I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure. 

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone! 

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace. I'm not there quite yet, but baby steps are okay."
test_id_452,"Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed, it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments . 

To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse , I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough . 
You are worth it and you are strong and if you feel you are being invalidated and ignored please talk to someone , there will always be someone who cares about you're mental health ."
test_id_453,"Nothing makes me feel anymore. I just want to stop being like this. Im wasting everyones time, I don't wabt to bother getting better when I can just aswell die and disapear. I don't have enough energy to do anything, Im just rotting and waiting for death, counting days"
test_id_454,"I used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything, I no longer believe that. I think hard work, wit, the help of others, and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone. This was quite a blow to me. I'm trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment."
test_id_455,Fucking. Holy fuck. Holy fucking shit. God take me early.
test_id_456,"All this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later. This fucking medicine doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just tired of it."
test_id_457,"I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year. 
I have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute. 
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me. 
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point. I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing. 
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain. 
Merry fucking Christmas to me."
test_id_458,"People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it鈥檚 not resolved, NO amount of 鈥渟ubstitutes鈥� can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can鈥檛 close.

test_id_460,"I wish there was an off switch that could be turned back on at will, ya know? Like a less permanent way to disappear. Just get off the grid for a while but then come back once I鈥檓 feeling better. Is it just me?"
test_id_461,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

&#x200B;

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin"
test_id_462,I can鈥檛 remember the things I did since 2013. Where did time go?
test_id_463,"I still live with my parents. I have been applying for electrical apprenticeships for a year now, easily applied for over 500 and no one has offered me any chances. 
People my age are buying apartments and in general just enjoying life. 

I have no friendships. I don鈥檛 get people. 

I鈥檓 a failure. 
Everyday I think about ending things because I don鈥檛 think I鈥檒l ever be able to make it."
test_id_464,I鈥檓 so sick of this never ending dark abyss
test_id_465,"I have nobody to talk to about the way i'm feeling. I'm falling deeper and deeper into this hole each day. Maybe I'm weak but I just wish someone would hold me about let me cry on their shoulder.

Update: I didn't expect to get any responses or replies, but the support from everyone is literally overwhelming. It warmed my cold heart. I hope you all are doing okay and hanging in there through the tough times"
test_id_466,"Sleeping is truly wonderful. Because while you鈥檙e asleep, you鈥檙e free. People say it鈥檚 like simulate death, but I think of it more like, a pause on life. Just a break. A moment where nothing can hurt you and you鈥檙e free."
test_id_467,become someone else and actually do something good with this life.. but its impossible. my only chance to be something is gone.
test_id_468,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point. But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?

EDIT: I'm literally crying my eyes out with the support that's pouring in and the stories you all are sharing. I had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me. I'm at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best, thank you for making me feel like I'm not absolutely alone. 

&#x200B;"
test_id_469,"It has happened more than once, usually I just try and get my mind off it and move on but sometimes it鈥檚 hard. 

What do you guys do?"
test_id_470,"This quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression I've ever encountered in literature. One of the few times I'm actually startled by my own reflection. Just thought I'd share.

I'd love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too."
test_id_471,"I鈥檓 sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I鈥檓 fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis. 

I鈥檝e been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I鈥檝e literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn鈥檛 even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it鈥檚 cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I鈥檒l be fine. 

Bitch, I鈥檓 not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn鈥檛 even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it鈥檚 just cannabis. 

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, 鈥渨ell no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that鈥檚 not really an option.鈥�

I鈥檓 so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I鈥檓 never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.


Edit, thanks for all the support guys, I鈥檝e got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that鈥檚 cool. 

Please stop upvoting and commenting haha, I never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol"
test_id_472,鈥測ou look depressed鈥� thanks it鈥檚 the depression
test_id_473,I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better.
test_id_474,"That鈥檚 it. Even the littlest things makes me feel like just a cut and it鈥檒l be over, only a couple of pills. I start planning for it. It鈥檚 been happening since I鈥檝e been 11. I think this is just my personality now.
Update: just broke into tears in front of my grandma and she said I was overreacting. I am broken. I could actually feel my heart break inside my chest. I never expected this from her. I just can鈥檛."
test_id_475,I used to have normal dreams and now there is... this.
test_id_476,"Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. 
It's the fear of failure but no urge or will to be productive.
It's wanting friends but hate socializing.
It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely.
It's caring about everything just to abruptly care about nothing.
It's the feeling of feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb.
It's wanting to get help, but subconsciously knowing it won't make a difference because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you are just tired of being in the tunnel."
test_id_477,"I know I鈥檓 not as mentally healthy when I鈥檓 tired. And I know that I鈥檓 going to be tired the next day if I don鈥檛 just f-ing go to sleep. And I know it will make everything feel worse. But it鈥檚 just a cycle I can鈥檛 seem to get out of.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the awards and all the time and care everyone has put into their comments. While I thought it would be comforting, I鈥檓 actually sad to see so many people relate to this. I鈥檓 sorry you鈥檙e all going through this. I hope you鈥檙e able to find peace. 鉂わ笍"
test_id_478,"Like a tree in a hurricane, and my roots don't grow deep.

I grab hold to anything I can find, but I'm tired of searching for things to hold on to.

The hurricane is forever stalled overhead. Some days it's stronger than others. But I realize there's nothing that can be done about that. 

And my roots never grow.

Why won't these stupid roots just fucking grow?!

Edit: Didn't expect this to strike a chord with so many of you. I love all my crooked neighbors. With my all my crooked heart."
test_id_479,"Yeah, that's basically what it boils down to.

That and I believe I am a horrible person who is unworthy of those things and I wouldn't even know how to be a real friend or lover anyway because I am so monumentally screwed in the head.

So I tell myself ""Oh, those people? They're not really friends. They don't really love each other that much. It's just for show. When there's no one recording, they hate each other just as much as everybody does"".

But in my heart of hearts, I know the truth. It's not them. It's me."
test_id_480,"I took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car鈥檚 exhaust into the driver鈥檚 side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over.

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

All I can think of lately is not messing up this time. It hurts because I鈥檓 a perfectionist, and I couldn鈥檛 get it right."
test_id_481,"I pretty much spent the majority of my early 20's doing exactly that. Eating fast food, laying in bed, and just getting by in life."
test_id_482,"Just hearing a voice from a youtube video or a series provides me with a little bit of comfort. It feels like I'm not entirely alone then. My friends can't really get through me and I'm constantly tired. In order for things to change I need to do something, but to do something I need energy... so yeah...

I want to sleep the entire time and I'm much more exhausted in general, but I'm also afraid. Will I feel better when I wake up or worse?"
test_id_483,"I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

EDIT: thank you for gold, hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers, sisters, and siblings get through these hard times"
test_id_484,"No. Please don't ever say that. If you said that once and you mean it, I hate you. You don't live my life and people that say that don't know anything about depression. It's one of the worst things you can ever say to someone depressed."
test_id_485,"There have been like, at least three suicides on the tracks this month and I so very much want to be one of them...but as much as I want to commit suicide I don't want to commit murder, and it would kill my mom if I did it, so here I am facing another lonely worthless year. I'm so tired of this, I'm just so, so tired. I don't know why I'm posting, like I said I'm not going to do it, I won't do that to my mom...but I really wish this could be over."

test_id_487,"I missed out on every important learning experience of youth because I chose to give into my anxiety, isolate myself, and take the path of least resistance. 

Even a life of constant mistakes would be better than this because at least one can learn from mistakes. Instead I've done nothing and learned nothing.

With every passing year I've missed more important milestones compared to my peers and it shows every time I have to interact with another person."
test_id_488,"When you鈥檙e 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don鈥檛 define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you鈥檙e now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life. Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can鈥檛 start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don鈥檛 waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with.

edit: a couple people are reading the first few sentences as if it鈥檚 in the present tense. it鈥檚 not, it鈥檚 a prediction of what my life will be because of my lack of motivation and poor decisions. 

also before you say it, YES i am young. YES you are probably much older than me. but does saying something like 鈥測ou鈥檙e young so shut up鈥� going to help in any way? no. it makes me feel worse about myself.

test_id_490,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start? 



Just needed to rant and vent a little. So if anyone actually read this far, thank you 鉂わ笍"

test_id_492,"Maybe this has been talked about in other posts but i'm new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain. 

Does anyone else feel like your head is a fog? or like your living a video game (controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached) The feeling of un-motivation, detachment and numbness has only gotten worse (i'm 21 now). I notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) Sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv. 

(i say sometimes to all of this because i have moments of feeling 'normal', or even periods of time. But it always leads back to that same empty hole)

I feel like my brain is broken, like i've been missing out on how everyone else feels."
test_id_493,"Normies won鈥檛 ever fucking understand. They don鈥檛 care if you have no friends , no girlfriend, borderline insanity from loneliness, no money, no direction in life and no hope for the future. They love to virtue signal and pretend they care."
test_id_494,"I feel confused and slow nearly all the time. I get stuck on the most simple mathematics. I sometimes need to check things like what does 4+19 equal to. It takes me ages to get jokes. Sometimes I wonder if 1000 grams equal to 1kg and google it.

Ive been depressed for as long as I can remember. I used to think I was a bright and fast in terms of my thinking 10 years ago. Im motivated to get my life on track once again but I feel like I need to get my brain working.

Do others experience this and to what degree? Are there any excersises to reverse this?"
test_id_495,"I'm 14
my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me. I'm sorry."
test_id_496,"I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly."
test_id_497,Lying on my bed..... fantasising another life maybe in some anime..... Anxious SO MUCH about things on my life..... Lonely ofcourse yeah that's my daily life.
test_id_498,"I was bullied in elementary school, and I always used to tell myself that it's only temporary, that life will be good later, like in the movies. All I have to do is wait until I'm 16, I'm gonna have friends, have a girlfriend, go to the parties and gradually get into life as an adult.

I'm 27 now. No friends, no girlfriend, I lost my job recently due to a work injury... the life never really got better. I'm no longer being bullied by other kids, I'm being bullied by my own head. Every year is another wasteful, unfulfilling stepping-stone on the road to death.

It doesn't get better."
test_id_499,"I can't go on. Im after finishing a 26oz bottle of vodka hoping to numb the pain even a little but it fucking ddidn't work. Im in a secluded parking lot in my car staring at my gun and ignoring all 100+ missed calls and shit I cant deal with it. Im going to kill myself within the hour. 

Suppose I feel like I had to write this down somewhhere.
